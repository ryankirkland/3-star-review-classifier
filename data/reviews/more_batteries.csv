Not at all close to the capacity charge. Stuck on 80%
","

  I have charged them 4 times back to back after marking ""charged/full"" but when I check, it's usually left on 75-80% full. It's not filling up to the capacity it said it should. Using the same brand for batteries and charger, and it's not so great. Really think I should of invested a little more money for actual reliable brands.

  The batteries are great and do what the say.  The issue I had was that they were not working with my Apple mouse.  As it turns out, the batteries are a fraction shorter than most others, which prevents the positive terminal from making a solid connection.

Not sure about others but you can see the comparison to a standard Duracell AA.  While they would be good for most applications, if a close fit is required, they may not be the battery of choice.

Charge Capacity Actually in the 2100s, NOT 2800 mAh - Think They'll Really Last 1200+ Cycles?
","

  Rechargeable batteries are a very easy product for a manufacturer/seller to lie about. Most people do not have battery testers, and YES, these POWEROWL batteries do actually recharge and discharge! That's all most customers know about them.The product description currently says this: ""Note: Please charge fully before use, as we only charge the batteries to 20% for shipping safety purpose. Batteries will reach top performance after 3-5 times fully charge cycles ""The photo showing my POWEROWL ""2800mAh"" AAs was taken at the completion of a sixth complete charge/discharge/charge cycle. I performed my tests before using the batteries for anything else. These batteries should be in their absolute prime. All of mine that I tested came in in the 2100s, between 75-78% of the advertised capacity. Based on other cheap ""high capacity"" rechargeable batteries I've bought from generic brands which have failed after dozens of cycles, I seriously doubt the POWEROWLs would last anywhere near the advertised 1200 charge cycles.For comparison, see the photo of my Panasonic ENELOOP batteries I purchased in 2016. They all charge to the 2500s, as advertised, and have been in use continuously since purchased. I have little doubt the Panasonic batteries will last for as many charge cycles, on average, as Panasonic advertises.If you can't trust POWEROWL about something easily testable like the capacity (see other reviewers who have found the capacity to be just as poor), why would you trust them that their batteries will last 1200+ charge cycles?I am returning the batteries. I suggest you buy Panasonic or Duracell rechargeables, which are actually high-capacity. Panasonic and Duracell are accountable companies who will not blatantly lie about their products, unlike faceless FBA sellers who do so much business thanks to lower prices that my return will do them no harm. Maybe my review will make a slight difference. It's not just about capacity, but the reliability you can expect from something sold by a company like this.

  I purchased these together with a powerowl 8 bay charger. At first, everything seemed fine but after a short while, when I would insert the dead batteries into the charger, instead of the light showing red like its supposed to, it would show green but with a flashing red as well. The green is supposed to mean charged and ready. The flashing red is supposed to mean the battery is defective. Both together, is a mystery to me.I reached out to the company and complained about the batteries already being dead and they asked me to submit a video. When I finally got around to sending them the video, it must have been past the return window because I never heard from them again.I use 6 of these at a time in a touchless trash can and because of the defective batteries in the mix, I only get about 2 days worth of use versus 2-3 weeks with regular batteries. I have put these into an Xbox controller and they lasted literally 1 minute.If I needed batteries for something important like a flashlight or something, it would NOT be these.

A couple cycles in and life seems great

  I have an eneloop charger which was purchased when my son got his xbox so that we could use rechargeable batteries more often... I've since slowly started to acquire more and more and use them elsewhere around the house, such as my shower radio, hair trimmer, remote controls, clocks, etc...The eneloop batteries are fantastic. So far, a few cycles in for the radio, a flashlight, and the life of the powerowl batteries is great as well. The powerowl are 2800mAh, compared to the eneloop @ 2000mAh, but those are also two years and maybe 15-20 full cycles into their life. That's still young, so I'm plenty happy with the comparison.The powerowl came in a pack of 16 for $27, so roughly $1.70 per battery. Originally, the eneloop's came in a set with the charger and some AAA batteries as well, but to buy them now (the latest gen is what's available to compare), they cost $3.25 per battery.If I continue to get this kind of life from a battery with consistent power for just over half the price, I'll order more AAA and maybe see if they have 9v options for things like garage door remotes and smoke detectors. I hate throwing away batteries after 6mo out of precaution from a detector when I could recharge instead. I currently have a stack of 9v batteries sitting waiting to be needed in the remotes because they last much longer. Since all my detectors are hardwired and linked, I could probably leave them in for a year or even 18-24mo and be safe, but it's just a habit that's better to maintain. If I eventually switch to powerowl brand rechargeables for anything else where my current stash of eneloop won't cover it, the current testing has me confident that they'll work just fine.Also, I read some things about the powerowl charger itself that weren't very flattering... Using the powerowl batteries with the eneloop charger, they charge quickly and do not get too hot. I think the issues might be with that charger, not the cells themselves.I'll revisit this review in 6mo and again in 12mo to see if the current performance is maintained with reasonable longevity per their age and cycles at the time. For initial performance and cost per battery/cell, these powerowl batteries are great.

  These are horrible quality.  I have been using rechargeable batteries for a very long time.  They should be able to be recharged over and over again.  I had 1 that never worked, wouldn't charge.  Then had at least another 4 that would never take a second charge.  Of course the return window was closed by the time I went through the process of discovering this.  Will never use this brand again.

  Wanted these to work, but unfortunately I’ve found that they don’t work for most things I try to use them in.  The Positive terminal ‘nub’ is shorter than average, so it doesn’t make positive contact in at least 75% or more of the various things I’ve tried to use them in.

THESE WON'T WORK WITH SOME (OR MANY?) DEVICES
","

  I bought these to use in my wifi linked door locks.  Charged them fully upon receipt and have tested them a few times and they do no work.  I can only presume it is because they are a lower no-load voltage than alkaline batteries, but it most certainly isn't enough to reach the threshold and start up what I got them for.  I followed up each test with a set of alkalines and the latter invariably worked.  I may use these in other AA applications, but I don't yet know if they'll work there either.  Mind you this is 16 batteries to choose from and test, so it wasn't just a fluke with one bad battery.  May want to check with manufacturer of whatever device you want to power up first.

Don’t waste your money. Spring for the brand name instead
","

  These are not 2800mAh batteries. I have some 1350mAh rechargeables from the brand that rhymes with stayovac that not only last longer but work better than these. For instance, I put 3 of these in a strand of string lights, the ones with the copper wire and they barely lit them up, put the  1350s in (which are not great batteries at all, the worst I’ve ever bought up until these) and they lit the strand like they should and I left both strands on for hours and within 2 hours, on a full charge, the strand of lights with these batteries were completely dead and the 1350s were just as bright as when I turned them on. You’re better off spending the extra money on brand names like the brand with the bunny or The brand that’s batteries are copper and black colored (my reviews always get flagged if I use brand names) I’ve bought a ton of off brands of rechargeables lately and none of them work as good as the brand names. If you need these for a tv remote that’s about all they’re good for... pretty disappointed in them, the reviews made them seem so promising. Definitely returning.

  I purchased AA's & AAA's back on January 6th. 2020.  When I purchased these batteries they were for my battery operated candles. I had assumed these batteries would last longer then a few nights of 4 to 6 hrs. of usage. I had to throw out 4 of the AA's & 4 of the AAA's cuz when I put them on the charger they blinked red & green which according to the info that came with the batteries....that meant the batteries were bad. So, I've only had these batteries for only 6 mos. & the life of them are terrible! I would've purchased Mr. Battery batteries again, but unfortunately they discontinued them. I did my research & thought the Powerprowl batteries sounded like a good investment, but apparently ""NOT!"" I would not recommend purchasing these batteries. I would've returned them, but conveniently I had no problems with them till after February when my window of opportunity was closed to return them. So buyer beware!!

  I do  underwater photography so go through a lot of AA batteries using my strobe, and on underwater flashlights on night dives.  I saw these online at a very good price so I decided to try these out and see how they worked.  First, I tested the batteries using my underwater camera strobe on full power, and got more than 200 shots out of it, which is fantastic!  So I know they had a lot of power.  So I've used them now on several dives, using different ones out of the pack, and they're all holding up very well.  I've never had my strobe or flashlight die on me during a dive yet.  They also charge up quickly in the Powerowl charger that I also purchased.  So I can definitely recommend.

  These are great for my controllers but they probably don’t last the full length of time they should for their capacity. Normal AA batteries are rated at 1.5v and these are labeled 1.2 volts so sensitive electronics may have issues using them. They are very light feeling too and they are just barely smaller than Duracell batteries so excessive shaking of the controller may briefly make the controller turn off.

  Only 2 out of the 16 batteries were able to ever charge to 1.5v which is the standard for AA batteries.

  These were nowhere close to 2800 mAh. I ordered the 16 pack, and using my battery charger I performed a refresh and charge on a full load, singles, doubles, no matter what I did, they did not perform.  Everything shows them as low, and they perform as such.These also discharge very fast, spend your money elsewhere on a different brand, don't do like me and give these indie batteries a chance, regardless of the 4.5 star reviews that are here on Amazon.I tried these in Xbox One controllers, VR controllers, wireless mice/keyboards, wii remotes, xbox 360 remotes.  These batteries are a complete waste, I wish I could refund them.Edit:  This is an updated review the manufacturer of these batteries reached out to me after reading my review and wanted to make it right with me so they offered to refund or replace these batteries.  I chose to replace them and the new batteries work great, I'm happy to report that it looks like I had a bad batch the first time.I originally rated these 1/5, I'm updating it to 3/5 because the new batteries work as advertised and adding an extra star for the customer service to reach out and try to make it right, bringing the grand total to 4/5 stars, I would love to rate it 5/5 but the hassle of it all and for review integrity/transparency I'm leaving it at a 4 stars.

  Update: I received an email offering a $20 Amazon gift card if I would delete this review. I believe the reviews are one of the main reasons to use Amazon. If they can be manipulated like this, we'll all end up buying junk with 5-star reviews. I'm declining the gift card; however, I will elaborate on my original review. I regularly swap out AA batteries on trail cameras, probably 30-40 batteries. I've always used Eneloop and after purchasing additional cameras, I thought I would try the Powerowl since the reviews were so good. Btw, I write the date on all of my batteries with a Sharpie so I know exactly how old my batteries are when I change them. Both cameras using Powerowl batteries were dead. All cameras running 2014-2019 Eneloops were still were running strong. Save money in the long run and buy Eneloops.Original: These are not comparable to Eneloops. I’ve had several fail and they don’t hold a charge nearly as long as 5-year old Eneloop batteries.

I have done this with other batteries that need charging, but some of them lost its power. I usually take them off when I see the Green light, but I watch until the light goes out and then I take them off the charger. Good Batteries.

  Was looking for a high capacity battery, and I thought I finally found a good one at a reasonable price...but alas, another battery brand that does NOT deliver what they promise (not as bad as the batteries on eBay, but nevertheless ~25% less capacity than advertised/paid for). Appear to be OK rechargeable batteries (did not test long shelf power retention claims/capability, but they were delivered with <50% charge), but expensive for the price when considering they do not deliver the advertised 2,800 mAh capacity, and you can instead buy Amazon or other rechargeable battery brands for less that deliver 2,000-2,100 mAh capacity. The Duracell rechargeable AA seem to be the ones that deliver on the 2,500 mAh capacity they advertise and are only ~20% higher cost vs. these batteries)...so giving them a try for my needs now.

  The positive contact on the POWEROWL batteries is too short to make contat with the corresponding contact in the flashlight, so no light produced at all.

About the same as Energizer 2000mAh
","

  I bought these because they were 2800mAh and wanted a long lasting battery for LED emergency lanterns. I placed three of these in one lantern and three Energizer 2000mAh in an identical lantern and turned them both on at the same time. The winner (brightest light at the end of the test) of the first test appeared to be Energizer (by a very slight margin). Then, I remembered reading somewhere that the Owls needed to be discharged/recharged a couple of times before reaching their full potential. I charged both sets overnight and ran the test again. After they had run down I really couldn't tell much difference in the brightness of each lantern. I recharged a third time overnight and ran the test a third time. When both lanterns reached the end of their usefulness, I might (might) have seen a small (very small) difference in brightness for the lantern with the Owl batteries.Conclusion... 2800mAh is 40% more than the 2000mAh so I expected better performance. However, I don't think the Owls were very expensive. If I were to buy again, I would compare the price of these 2800mAh batteries to other 2800mAh and Energizer 2000mAh. I would not pay more for the Owls if Energizer was the same price. I might try 2800mAh made by a different company if they were not too expensive. Last note... I think the Owls were made in China and Energizer is made in Japan.

My experience
","

  I use these batteries to power my speedlites and wireless trigger I purchased.  I absolutely love the refresh time I get from one to the next, it's almost instant.  I tend to run my flash on about 1/8 - 1/16 power which for lack of a better term this is about medium power setting.  My dissatisfaction with the batteries is after about 5 minutes or 10-15 flashes my battery meter shows about 75% usage left and  if I'm shooting an event that lasts for hours I'd have carry a bag full of rechargeable batteries and that's not convenient nor cost effective for me.  In contrast, I purchased some non-rechargeable batteries, Energizers and I didn't reach 75% until after close to 70 or 80 flashes.  However my refresh time on the same settings was not as fast. Took me 2-3 seconds to refresh and any photographer can tell you that could cost you to miss some important shots especially at a wedding.

Updated Review
","

  So I’ve tried 4 of the 16 batteries in this pack and they are anything but remarkable. Other reviews say the work better than what they expected, but compared to the Energizer 2000 mah Batteries I usually use they are weak. I use a Nikon camera for work, takes 2 AA batteries and these last about 2 hours maybe 200 pictures. New energizer batteries go 2 days minimum and well over 1000 pictures. I hoped for better, but unfortunately these will end up being solar lite  batteries .Update on Customer Service .  I was contacted in May 2020 regarding this review byKrystal in Customer service. Since I am not using any of the remaining batteries due to the required Voltage in my devices  (cameras ) I was fully refunded my cost .. Excellent customer service

  Unlike their charger, these batteries are constructed of very good materials. They do not feel cheap at all. These batteries are on the level of Eneloops for a lower cost. Once you have rechargable batteries in your house, you never want to go back. I use these primarily in Xbox controllers and they last quite a long time per charge

  I put some of these AAs into some different items and most didn't work UNTIL I pushed the batteries ahead towards the positive end.  It appears that the overall battery may be slightly larger than the ones I have been using and as such they hang up when replacing them... So I would put the batteries in and then shift them slightly towards the positive post and then they would work... So to me they are a little tight overall but can fix them by shifting them forward.  Not sure yet of overall performance.

I just popped 4 more in there.2019.09.05I just purchased the 16 pack of these POWEROWL AA Rechargeable batteries.  They are 1.2V NiMH with a claimed 2800 mAh capacity. I ran it through my battery charge/discharge-test cycle and the first four came up ranging from about 2000 to about 2100 mAh. It fell quite short of the claimed 2800 mAh. I'm now doing a second set of 4 and will post when I get the results.  By contrast, my 4+ year old La Crosse AA were rated 2600 mAh and now measure around 2000-2100 mAh. The Sanyo Eneloop are rated 1900 mAh (and is about 2 years old) and measures around 1800 mAh.  My only speculation is that if the POWEROWL starts off already well below its rating when they are 'new', I can only imagine what the degradation might be like in future years.  A little disappointed, I will update as I do each batch of 4 (of the 16 batteries).

  Before I get started, I'm not a long time rechargeable battery user.  So this may be typical.The batteries charged, no problem. I used them in various flashlights and such, no issues and was happy with the longevity. However, when I put them in my 12 volt trail cameras they keep reading low battery. I know they run 1.2 volts each and are .05 volts less than the typical AA battery, but I wouldn't think that would warrant a low battery warning.That being said the camera does work, however it doesn't like to take video (biggest battery drain). I get one good 20 second clip, maybe two, then it gives me a black screen. Something I didn't get with traditional AA batteries.Will they save me money? Perhaps.

  I have had my POWEROWL AA batteries for a couple weeks now.  They look nice and have a premium feel to the construction. They arrived with about a 1/4 to 1/3 charge.  I charged them fully with my existing AA battery charger.  They have worked well in my LED under-cabinet lights and video game controllers. I will do a longer test to see how well they work under repeated charging.Just a warning, some devices do not work well with high mAh rechargeable batteries.  For example, I have some LED path lights that only work with 2100 mAh or lower batteries.  Some other devices need the full 1.5V vs 1.2V that rechargeable batteries provide.  This is not a deficiency with POWEROWL, just rechargeable batteries in general.Also, don't forget to register them with the company's website to get a longer warranty.

  I have not used these batteries until now. They are a similar brand to one that I have purchased before.  Enerloop.  somebody reviewed them though, and said they were just as good. We just entirely possible, sometimes a Chinese company will remake a product, and it basically is made with the same parts that the big name brand is. So I gave it a shot. These things are just as good. The battery life is really good, they recharge well, and they're a bunch cheaper then the enerloops.

  I bought this for the batteries, because I have chargers already, but this charger, which I considered basically a freebie throw-in, is the best charger I have hands down. The batteries don't need to be charged in pairs. It checks them for health. It charges them independently, quickly, and displays a color-coded status for each that can be checked from across the room.The batteries themselves have a fairly long life per charge in my Xbox controller, and so far don't seem to have suffered any degradation, but all batteries do eventually so time will tell. Very satisfied, worth the money for the charger alone.

Best rechargeable batteries and best brand there is.
","

  These are the best rechargeable batteries there are. Simply the best. Cant compare them to the Amazon brand, but these work flawless.If you get an freshly made new product, these will not disappoint you.I went only with Panasonic Eneloop smart chargers, AA and AAA batteries.I recommend. Buy with confidence.WARNING! - If the package is somewhat weird and deviates in looks, colour and orthography just the slightest from the original, its most likely an counterfeit product. I wanted to buy these on eBay but realised that allmost all of the packages are different on at least one aspect and that is an indicator of an counterfeit item. Those products come most of the time from China or have chinese kind of names. Stay away from these counterfeit products. Thats why I bought these on amazon since on amazon you can be more sure the products are genuine and new (if sold by amazon itself). On the other hand often eBay is today cheaper since amazon got in the last time quit pricey (I bought on eBay an Asus Zenfone Live L1 new for 70 US$ which was on Amazon 114$ same fone - meanwhile I bought on amazon an Samsung J3 2018 fone which was defective from the beginning and no warranty was ever honoured). So, to know from whom you buy and to look for counterfeits is most important specially with batteries with an high value brand such as Panasonic Eneloop ist which are Made in Japan. These Eneloops batteries are well known to be copied and counterfeited by chinese. Look for weird and different colour of packaging, writing mistakes, weird fonts, orthographic errors, etc. As well I had several Amazon Fire Tablet batteries bought from eBay who do not hold the charge, same for batteries bought from amazon for smartphones which most likely did not contain sufficient chemicals and were manufactured cheaply to save a dime on materials as such as they did not hold the charge. This brand is such a product which is highly copied and thus watch out for counterfeit items.

This review is for the charger, NOT the batteries
","

  I needed some additional AAA rechargeable batteries and I've had good luck with Eneloops. This time I noticed the four-pack of batteries with a four position charger. The charger I've been using only handles two batteries at a time, so I thought that this might speed up recharging the batteries in a light that uses three AAA batteries.This is the WORST design imaginable for a battery charger:1.  The batteries lay very loosely in the slots and will fall out with the least movement. In other chargers the battery clicks into position and you can turn it over and the battery will not fall out.2. The built-in plug at the back requires the charger to lay perfectly horizontal.  That means the charger can only be used when plugged into a horizontal power strip, thus taking up three outlets on the power strip itself. It can't be plugged into a wall socket or used with an extension cord, ONLY a horizontal power strip.3. There us no charging indicator light of any kind.  The charger I have been using has a small screen that shows the charging level and when full charge has been reached. According to the instructions, you have to guess at the time elapsed since you put the battery on the charger.Panasonic really screwed up this design. I expected much better.

These batteries last a very long time. They are a must have for gamers
","

  I have had my Eneloop batteries for a while now. They are great for my Xbox One controllers, as those do not have rechargeable batteries, so I use Eneloops to power my Xbox One controllers and my other wireless controllers. I have used Eneloops for almost 3 years now and they are still kicking strong. The amount of batteries I have saved is in the dozens. These things just keep their charge so well, and I haven't had one die on me yet. I really like their high quality and I have a lot of devices that need AA batteries still, so these are a nice way to save money by just recharging them after they die. If you are looking for batteries for an Xbox or GameCube controller that is wireless these work super well. They also work well on Xbox 360 controllers.One thing to note about rechargeable batteries is that the voltage is lower on them 1.2V instead of 1.5V of a standard AA, so in rare cases you might get weird performance in some electronics that require 1.5V to function properly. I have a modded Gameboy Advance that I put a backlit screen into, and these Eneloops make it think that the GBA is at low-power mode, so the red Power LED flashes constantly. That's the only thing to watch out for.For remote controls, video game console controllers, and CD players these batteries work well. I would highly recommend people pick them up for their TV remotes or anything that they need to replace batteries in.

came fully charged, updated review

   I measured the voltage upon receipt and all had 1.38v. Then put on a 5 hour charger when completed the charge in 30 minutes.  Not the best scientific analysis but at least these were not in a less than 50% State of Charge.Time will tell if these performance as advertised.Update 8/12/2020. After using the Eneloops for 4 cycles, I ran a test using the Panasonic BQ-CC65e. Results conclude that these are decent batteries. 798 mah. I will update what the discharge rate that was used once I figure that out. A good charger is important and the charger/tester is available on eBay only because they sell it outside of USA only for some reason. If you do purchase one, get a Europe plug to USA plug adapter. It supports 110v 60hz. I am in California USA.

  We bought these years ago and loved them. When those started to go we repurchased and sadly, they do not hold the charge like the previous batch. We even bought a brand new charger thinking it was that. It wasn't. Using them in remotes they last for a day or two before needing to be recharged. Not sure why they aren't as good as the previous ones in the same brand. Still love to have rechargeables on hand though.

  Nothing to find fault with. Assuming you have an external battery charger from the likes of nitecore you never have to but batteries again. They recharge up to sum 2100 times and do.

Efficient, Long Lasting Performance
","

  These are some of the longest lasting batteries I’ve used so far. I have all kinds of rechargeable batteries, and use them in a variety of products. Duracell was the only one that seemed to perform the best- it was the only one that charged fast, lasted long, allowed me to use it halfway through charging, etc- until I got this. If you need fast, efficient, long lasting and versatility/flexibility (ie, you aren’t looking to buy a rechargeable docking station, etc. -these work well in gaming controls) these charge fast and hold their power.

Amazing batteries - perfect for Oculus controllers
","

  I recently got an Oculus Quest and the controllers use AA batteries so instead of constantly replacing batteries, spending way more money AND destroying the environment, I decided to give these rechargeable ones a try. Boy am I glad I did. These batteries are phenomenal, at least for my use anyway. For the first week I used regular brand name AA batteries and they were dead in less than 2 weeks. Instead of constantly having to buy batteries I decided to try some rechargeable ones instead. I shopped around looking for batteries with the largest capacity and longest life and I landed on the Panasonic Eneloops after much research.Let me tell you, if you're still using throw away batteries, you should stop right now. Not only are they terrible for our planet, but they will also cost you significantly more in the long run. With how much use my Oculus and remotes get I would've purchased at least 10 batteries by now so I've already made my money back with this purchase. The life of these batteries is incredible to be honest. With the regular AAs I got about 7-10 days of use in the Oculus remotes. With these batteries I'm getting up to 3 weeks of use before they need a recharge. I was amazed when I used them 2-3hrs a day, everyday for a week and they still had 70% life left. Considering I'm only charging them about once a month these should last many, many years. If you need batteries for Oculus Touch or any remote, controller or small appliance then these should be perfect. Spend $10 on a charger and these will save you a ton of money in the end, in addition to saving our planet. What more can you ask for?

Low-waste + Saving $$
","

  I've used these for over a month and they work perfectly. These only go in my xbox controller (b/c it eats up batteries) and I love them for a few reasons:  (a) they work; (b) they're a great low-waste substitute; (c) after a few more months of use, these will start saving me money on batteries (that may not sound like a good deal, but I've been gaming for decades and I don't plan to stop soon).These rechargeable batteries last as long as Duracell AAs, in my experience. Also, they only take about 30-45 minutes to charge fully. No explosions in the electrical outlet, thankfully! That being said, I don't leave them charging for hours -- I unplug the charger as soon as its light turns green.

maybe they just aren't good in flashlights
","

  while they charge up quickly and don't appear to get overly hot during charging, they expend energy quickly for a flashlight.  If Purchased single use batteries I would not have to replace them so quickly.  For example.  3 AAA batteries are in the flashlight after being fully charged up.  I walk my dogs for maybe a maximum of 10 minutes, but most likely an average of about 5 minutes at night.  I've had to recharge the batteries every other night after the first time I used them (they lasted a while...maybe a 7-10 days at that usage) the first charge.  When I replace with regular AAA batteries I don't have to replace them every other night or every 7-10 days.

Suckered by the Hype
","

  There was so much hype and so many articles about Eneloop batteries, that I made the mistake of thinking they couldn't possibly be sub-par with so many reviewers. I was wrong. It's all a money-making scheme. I had 8 NiMh Energizers and 8 NiMh Duracell ""AA"" rechargeables, all of which outperformed these 2100 mAh Eneloop batteries. The Energizer batteries were almost 20 years old, and held charge in my wireless mice/trackpads for about 45 to 40 hours of regular use. The Duracell reghargeables were newer (I had only been using them for about 6 years), and they lasted well over 60 hours of regular use in wireless mice and trackpads.I put the Eneloop ""AA"" NiMh rechargeables in 6 days ago for their very first use. They registered 85% charged on the power management application. I have used 2 in a wireless mouse and 2 in a wireless trackpad for less than 20 hours on each device for a total of about 35 hours between the two devices, and both are already down to the final 1/3 of their original signal (25% and 26%, respectively).This is not what I had expected, given all of the articles, write-ups, reviews, and commercial attention from so many big names in electronics. I should have hung on to my 20 year-old Energizers.

  I bought 4 of these batteries four years ago based on the hype.  I used them in pairs and rotated the pairs.  Each pair was probably recharged 75 times (substantially less than the 2000 recharges advertised)  in a Panasonic BQ-CC17 charger I bought when I bought the batteries. [The charger still works great.]  I quit using the batteries about a year ago because they quit holding a charge and went back to the Rayovacs I still had from before I bought these Enloops.  I used them as backups so I charged them in the Panasonic charger occasionally while using these Enloops. Before buying the Enloops I had used Rayovac rechargeables for 10 years with no problems.  This pair of Rayovacs had probably been recharged 150 times before I started using them again three years later.  They still hold a charge and have worked great for the past year.

Weak

  They barely last a few days in a remote control which is barely pressed. Non-rechargeable cheap ones, which I used before I switched to these, lasted a couple of weeks in the same remote with the same amount of usage.I bought them and their matching charger directly from Amazon, not a third-party seller, and so they shouldn't be knock-offs.I'm disappointed at the comparable lack of longevity. I bought them to be more responsible, environmentally-speaking, but there are likely better rechargeable batteries out there.Also, these batteries take a long time to get their strength back. (And yes, I did get the proper Panasonic charger for them.) Given how briefly they last before needing a charge, that's annoying. If they lasted longer, then I wouldn't mind the charging time.In my opinion: they're like marathon runners that keep falling over, but at least *eventually* they'll go farther than others (and by others, I mean one-use batteries) and, since I've got 'em, I might as well let 'em go until they can't run anymore. But I'm not pleased with them.

Decent Batteries, Although Issues With Charger and/or Batteries Holding Charge.
","

  This review is for both the batteries and the quick charging device from Panasonic.I recently purchased some of these Eneloop batteries off of Amazon, as well as the Panasonic BQ-CC55 Battery Quick Charger, both shipped and sold by Amazon (to guarantee they were both legitimate products).To my dismay, every time they are fully charged and remove them from their BQ-CC55 charger and immediately put them back on the charger, they display an orange light (as if they were not fully charged). This happens every single time, regardless if I put them back in the charger immediately, or 10 days later. Are all of my batteries defective? I'm not sure. I messaged the company and am currently waiting for a response.Additionally, I use these batteries for several devices. When they are dying, in not always,warned before they do. (E.g. the Xbox would always warn me with regular batteries, or even aftermarket rechargeable battery packs, but not these). This is an issue when I am in a serious game, and my controller dies randomly.Lastly, my Xbox never displays that they are fully charged, either. It states they are at about 70-80 percent charge, even after they appear green on the BQ-CC55 charger. You could say this is due to software issues with Microsoft or Xbox, but again, I have not had this problem with any other disposable battery or rechargeable battery pack I gave used in any of my Xbox controllers in the past.Note that in the photo, the light appears white, but in reality it is orange, meaning the batteries are not yet fully charged, but not fully depleted, either.

  These Panasonic Ni-MH Eneloops batteries are some of the the best with the exception of purchase cost.While I have some cheaper alternatives that are fantastic (Ikea's Japanese made LADDA batteries that some people think are Eneloops Pro relabelled), these are a reliable investment that are safe to use in electronics unlike cheaper non-rechargable batteries that can leak. Also unlike the Eneloops Pro, they have more recharge cycles (2100 vs 500) at the cost of less capacity and current capability.Would I buy more of them? Sure.

  They're expensive. These are supposed to be among the best rechargeables. I disagree. The batteries work fine once they're charged but they go fast. When I checked the charging level after a ""full 48-hour charge"" I saw that they only had charged to 76%. So right from the start they are a quarter used up. When I inserted new Duracell traditional batteries in my same device I see the charge level was 100%. If you don't mind switching them out very often compared to traditional batteries they're fine.

Beware!  This AAA's are only 1.2 volts!!!
","

  When I saw this set of Panasonic rechargeable batteries I decided to buy them due to the reputation of the brand name--for the most part. However, as soon as I opened the package I noticed that each battery had only a charge of 1.2 volts max. instead of the 1.5V that every freaking AAA comes with!  When I tried to use them on my remote, for instance, I immediately received an warning light indicating that the batteries were low, even though they have been fully charged!  So I ended up returning them for a refund and go with traditional alkaline (non-rechargeable) ones instead.  Just for anyone's reference, the majority of regular batteries (AA's, AAA's, C's, D's etc.) stop working almost as soon as their charge falls below 1.5 volts.  I've tested numerous worn out batteries of different sizes with a multimeter before disposing of them and I always noticed that they still have between 1.2 to 1.4 volts left in them!  This is information that I'm sure most battery companies don't want you to hear :)

","

  Was using 3-4 year old Duracell 2500ma NIMH AA at first in the Quest Touch controllers and was having serious tracking problems. Switched to the 1800ma Eneloop (white) AA and now I rarely have any problems. Do not use the 2500ma (black) Eneloop Pro because they're made to discharge quickly at a high output (like for digital cameras and flashes) and will drain too quickly causing tracking issues. I'm assuming, due to my experience with the 2500ma Duracell AA, that this is probably the same across all brands.Now as long as they have at least a 70% charge and the headset is over 60% they track great. I can play Beat Saber on Expert and almost never have tracking glitches. Should work on the Rift S Touch controllers as well. I did not have any problems with the 2500ma Duracell in the Rift CV1 Touch controllers but they don't use inside-out camera tracking like the new model Rift & Quest.

Long Lasting, Never Leak, Hold Their Charge, Low Heat
","

  The Panasonic Eneloop batteries (AA, AAA) are very reliable.  I've never had one leak, and out of about 100 batteries, have only had one or two fail, after about 8-10 years of use.  These batteries produce little heat when in use, hold their charge for a very long time while not in use (loosing less than 1% charge per month), and function well in flash lights, scales, remote controls, kitchen and bath scales, camera flashes, underwater strobes, and in every other application I've tried them in.  Unlike famous brand alkaline batteries, these have never leaked while installed in any product I have placed them in, and have never damaged any of my electronics.  Highly, highly, highly recommended.  Stop buying alkaline batteries, and buy these.  They will pay for themselves many times over when compared to alkaline batteries.

  First off I only buy from Amazon seller due to some reviews about fakes. The 8 pack I received are genuine from the stamping on the side of the cells. These batteries have been working good in our electronics but I have only cycled them a couple times so far. They are BK-3MCCA8BA which are 1.2v with minimum of 1900 mAh. When I opened the pack I tested all of them. They measured average of 52% at 1.21 volts and 2100 mAh. I got these when they were on sale for $18.04 for a 8 pack of AA in May of 2020.They are little more expensive then other name brands but they seem to have a good reputation.

The best rechargeable battery
","

  Instead of continually buying batteries (everything seems to need them these days) I invested in a quality charger and rechargeable batteries.  I have tried various ones.  The ones made in China maybe last a year.  The absolute best ones are made in the USA but are hard to find.  Then comes eneloop.  I have had great results with the ones made in Japan.  I have been warned not to buy the Chinese ones.  The Japanese ones just continue to work and work.  I have reordered them 3 times as I throw out dead Chinese ones.  I will continue to use these as they are the best that I can find to buy these days.  Not cheap, but you get what you pay for.

  I have bought a ton of these batteries. Every toy needs 3-4 batteries each and you have to change them constantly. This is a great way to save on batteries in the long run and charge relatively in a short time. They seem to hold their charge for a good amount of time as well. Some things, like my battery candles go through battery charges every week and a half, but other things they last for months. I guess it really depends on the battery application. I will continue to buy these as I am very happy with them.

  And while there are better options for rechargeable batteries nowadays, these still hold up well. They do take a long time to charge, but they work.

  I bought both the AA and AAA's and It's a lie, they don't hold 70% of their charge for 10 years.  My blood Ox meter with Alkaline batteries lasts about 2 years using it a few times a week.

With 2 freshly charged AA's, less than a month.  So if I'm constantly having to re-charge the batteries at the most in-opportune times mind you, they're totally worthless and very unreliable.

Since I first bought Eneloop I haven't changed brands
","

  Eneloop has always proven to last longer than other rechargeables and that hasn't changed. I bought a 4pk of AAAs specifically for a light that turns on in my bathroom when it detects movement. And lately even when days have been darker, the light has been turning on more than usual. Using regular batteries, the light was bright-ish for a few days then would start to go dim. By 1 1/2 weeks, you could barely see in the light at all. I got tired of wasting time with regular batteries simply because I didn't have enough rechargeables, so I bought more. I received them on March 24th, 2020. I charged them fully by that night and put them in the light. I had no idea the light could get as bright as it did with these. I was already impressed. And now this morning, 10 1/2 days later, the light has finally dimmed (and not to the point where it was completely useless, but enough to warrant charging them again). I really love my Eneloop.Don't waste time and money on other batteries. My experience with other rechargeables is they last just as long as regular batteries no matter how much they change the packaging and talk a good game. The only use for other rechargeables has been to have batteries you never throw away. Put Eneloop in all remotes in your house and never have to charge them again. Seriously. I took my batteries out of two remotes while waiting for these to arrive and didn't even charge them before putting them in the light and it was as bright as if I had put regular, new batteries in it. Those batteries had been in those remotes for about a year and they are used everyday. That's how superior Eneloop is. Back when I used my digital camera everyday, regular batteries died in 2 weeks, but my Eneloop only needed to recharge once every 6 months.

  THIS IS MY SECOND PURCHASE OF THESE FINE BATTERIES.

SPEND THE SMALL EXTRA COST AND ENJOY USING A RECHARGEABLE BATTERY THAT EXCEEDS EXPECTATIONS.

  These are replacing my 8 year old, constantly used, Eneloop batteries and I'm re-purchasing them for one reason: they work.  They have great longevity--I use them in a camera flash (Canon 600), in various headlamps and closet lights--and when they started to finally wear out, I was so used to them working I thought it was the flash, or the headlamp or other fixture rather than the batteries.  They do finally wear out, but compared to a one-time use battery, 8 years is pretty great for the planet, the pocketbook, and my peace of mind.

  We have a set of Panasonic cordless phones for may be 20 years. Finally their batteries would not hold charge for more than a day. I was going to replace them with a new set but buying a set of landline phones is dated so I looked at changing the batteries. They had regular AA batteries by Panasonic. So I ordered these same batteries and they are working great in all the sets! An inexpensive fix and no more annoyances of running out of charge while talking!

Occasionally, I notice that there is still a lot of praise for these batteries from tech experts who seem well informed about rechargeable batteries.  They are fantastic as far as I can tell - they power scores of things in my apartment.  (I now have a hundred or more AA and AAA batteries scattered around in every gizmo i own.

  I've been replacing all my cheaper rechargeable batteries as they die, with Eneloops. I've been using them everywhere, soap dispensers, remotes, clocks, game controllers... The older ones I relegate to landscaping lights and get some more use out of them.

Barely worth it
","

  These batteries worked for a full day the day I got them, now they last maybe 2 hours in a headlamp before dimming so far its like not having the light at all.  Regular batteries are far more worth the value when I only have to replace them every few weeks instead of having to recharge every two hours ruining my work flow and causing frustration.I could buy 10 more batteries and hot swap them constantly, and I may have to.  But realistically I think I'll just go buy a pack of batteries and use disposable ones instead.  I wouldnt recommend this for anything that needs constant power.  Maybe if you put these in a remote control for the TV it would be fine - but constant power they just drain too quick and its really not worth the $20.

  These batteries are great. I measured the voltages with a multimeter and they all had voltages around 1.3 volts (above the 1.2v rating). I've read some bad reviews on them, but I guess I was lucky.  Expensive, yes. However, I have not had any problems with them as yet.  So far, they are lasting quite a while in the applications I'm using them for. Very pleased.

  These batteries are in line with most other no-frills, or multi-branded batteries. For even the most basic use, like in remote controls, these batteries are not worth the extra money. I have found that eneloop Pro batteries are an Excellent Value, and I thought these might be acceptable for the price, BUT THEY ARE NOT. I recommend the Amazon Basics, if you can't spend extra on eneloop Pros, or the other highly rated batteries. Duracell, Rayovac  and Energizer Rechargeable batteries seem to be true to their label. I do have high hopes for EBL, and I plan on reviewing them next, but to get the best performance for your money, stick with one of the name brands listed, for now.

Best rechargeable batteries.

  I have a set that still hold a usable charge that are over a decade old. These things will last.

Died after 6 months. First recharge.

  I used my batteries on a remote and after 6 months when I put it to charge, one of the batteries was dead. It does not charge anymore, doesn't even get detected by the charger. That was the FIRST time I was going to recharge it, so I am very disappointed.
