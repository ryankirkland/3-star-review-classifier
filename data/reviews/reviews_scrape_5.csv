  Since I have been using this batteries to power one of my battery operated personal fans, I noticed that they can power it for 4 to 6 hours before noticeably losing energy or becoming completely depleted.  I suggest that you buy at lease 16 of them so that you can always have 8 fully charged and ready for use.  Also, you will need to have a good quality battery charger in order to re-charge them overnight.  One very good thing that I noticed is that if you completely discharge the batteries, they still appear to completely recover after you have re-charged them.

  The Amazon high capacity 2400 minimum mAh rechargeable batteries would have been a decent value for the money, if only they worked as expected.  You won't be able to use them right out of the package though, since they were only about half charged.  However, the worst problem is that after discharging/charging the 8 batteries (3 times each), I only achieved on average 2260 mAh.  None of the batteries ever hit the minimum 2400 mAh, as stated on the batteries themselves.  These batteries used to be manufactured in Japan, but have since been switched to China, thus the lower mAh results.  For most people looking for high capacity batteries, these are probably a definite pass.  I had Amazon pick-up my battery order for a full refund...

  I've been using the amazon branded batteries for a number of years now for our iMac keyboards and mice.  Full charge on those older batteries only reaches about 85% and is fully drained within 2-3 workdays.This new generation of batteries just simply doesn't work. The light on the mice rarely kick on and if they do, they won't connect over Bluetooth. Similar with keyboards. The batteries work in flashlights and kids' toys just fine.

My Logitech G602 indicates the battery at 50% or less within 24 hours of swapping a fresh charged pair of the Amazon batteries into my mouse.I will be requesting a refund/replacement as I barely have 8-10 charge cycles on these cells.Just.Plain.Bad.

  I purchased these batteries as each battery was less expensive than the comparable Eneloop. I will never make this mistake again. I have had these batteries for about 3 years, assuredly less recharges than the ""hundreds"" of times that the marketing materials purport that each battery could be charged before failing, but out of the original 8 purchased four now no longer charge. I am not the best at maths but that is at least a 50% failure rate at a minimum of half of the number of alleged charges. The Eneloops that I purchased two years prior are still working as advertised without a single failure. I will continue to pay the money for the Eneloops knowing that it is not money wasted.

  When I saw these batteries, I was skeptical that they would live up to the hype. They did not. Right from the start they had a low charge. When I tried to charge them, the best I could get was 80% capacity on only one of the batteries. I returned them and got a replacement.The new batteries were charged, but quickly lost it when using in low power devices like an analogue wall clock. I recharged them and they seemed to hold it for longer. However, the ones not in use lost their charge in about a month. I should have gotten a refund at that point, but I didn't.A year out, they will not charge at all. They are dead. Don't waste your money on these, buy Eneloop or Duracell rechargeable batteries. They work much better.

  I bought these to power a device with a ""slide-in and replace the cover to complete the circuit"" kind of battery compartment. The compartment accommodates standard alkaline AA batteries just fine, but these rechargeables are slightly fatter.

  These are AA batteries but whatever Amazon used to wrap the batteries to label them Amazon Basics is too thick and it makes fitting them in designated AA spaces tricky. Some things the batteries work and some things they don't. Be leery of purchasing these.

  Amazon batteries rechargeable are basically a waste of money because overtime they don’t  hold a charge as long it’s more frustrating then it’s worth.

  The score on remote control was left  blank.  Amazon needs an N/A option.  There is no remote.Anyway, I use a lot of AA batteries with my immitation candles.  This was the perfect answer.  I ordered more batteries for my other AA battery uses.I did find the charger a bit finicky. The charge is in pairs.  There is a light that comes on when it is charging.  Last time I paid attention to this and had trouble getting the light on.  I didn't pay attention to it the 1st time and there were no issues.  I may just need to ignore it.  Slap 4 batteries in and walk away.

  I have had a great experience with the batteries in the past. (I currently have a 16 of them, all going strong, used primarily for Xbox controllers)I just got another set and I notice the design changed. They now show that they are made in China, not Japan so I cannot vouch for their quality going forward.

Using with AmazonBasics charger resulted in several batteries going bad.
","

  I bought these together with the AmazonBasics charger. They worked great at first but after a few times recharging I started getting the red blinking light on the AmazonBasics charger. After some trial and error I figured out one of my batteries was bad which was causing the light. So I threw that battery away and things were fine again. Until a couple more recharges and then the light was back and once again another battery was bad. I threw that one away as well and the cycle has repeated now that my pack of 8 batteries is down to 4. I'm not sure if the problem is the batteries or the charger but my recommendation is to avoid both products.

  Super high quality. I researched rechargeable batteries extensively before making my purchase, and the reason I sprung for these is because there are lots of talks from electrical engineers that Amazon went with a very high end Japanese battery maker to Re label these (this is a good thing...)When i put the batteries on a charging unit I learned that most of them would take nearly 3000 mAh worth of charge, which is more than Amazon rates them for

  I use these batteries primarily in my sons ""Magic Track"" cars.  He runs them until they completely die.  For most of the batteries, when this happens, I can put them on my Eastshine S4 charger and they will charge back up just fine.  However, at least 2 of the 8 batteries deplete so far that the charger only displays ""Err"" because they don't even have enough charge left to detect what type of battery it is.  The only way to fix them is to ""jump start"" the bad battery by crossing a paper clip on the battery charger + terminals from one AA that is actively charging to the dead one.  It's not safe.

No Longer A Quality Product - Now Crap AA Cells

  I have always been a big fan of the (Made In Japan) Amazon Basic Capacity Capacity 2400 mAh NiMH AA Batteries and own 96 examples.  Their performance and reliability have been second to none.  For my birthday I Required 2 new trail/wildlife cameras I’ll be using along with my other wildlife cameras in a research projects that I will be conducting over the next three years.  So on November 3, 2019 I purchased 16 more of these Amazon Basic High Capacity AA batteries.  Few days after acquiring the new batteries I put them in my chargers and charge them to full capacity... after the initial condition in charge and discharge.  Then on December 6, 2019 I took the batteries out of the case that I had them in and tested them before putting them into my trail cameras, and the batteries were at less the 50% capacity !!!I recharge the batteries and inserted them into the cameras and placed them out on the evening of December 6, 2019.  On Christmas day November 25, 2019 I removed the two trail cameras from the field and the batteries were almost completely dead After roughly 600 images and 2 second videos!  My other Amazon Basic 2400 mAh batteries in to other cameras were still showing a full charge.I examined the batteries that I bought on November 3, 2019, and instead of being made in Japan as my 96 other cells are, these new batteries are made in China!I cannot tell you how very disappointed I am in these new ‘Made in China’ Amazon Basic Crap Quick Self-discharge low-capacity AA batteries are.  They have a less capacity then Tenery Centura 2000 mAh low self-discharge AA... and the Centura AA are genuine low self discharge cells.Amazon had an excellent product in their original Made In Japan Amazon Basic High Capacity AA, but now they’ve replaced them with unreliable reliable poor performing crap!

Physical size was a few shavings larger than a standard AA
","

  I bought the High Capacity AAs and have had them for about 10 months now. Unfortunately,  I've had 2 major issues with them.  1. It's surprising but these High Cap AA batteries from Amazon Basics seem to be just ever so slightly larger (physically) than Standard Alkaline AAs (like Duracells, Energizers).  2. Three of the batteries no longer held charge for very long after about 3 -4 month of very light useSo regarding the size, I was really surprised.  Eyeballing it looked about he same,  but every device I put them into (kids toys, Xbox Controller battery packs, etc, they were really snug and in some cases, made them really hard to remove from the device so I can recharge them.  For some devices, I was just a little fed up and decided to go back to using Alkalines for those devices until I ordered a set of Eneloops to replace these.As for the batteries that don't hold a charge for long, maybe I got duds.  I generally really have good luck with AmazonBasics products.  Maybe going high-capacity was pushing the boundaries of quality control on the batteries. It's also possible I left them too long between uses (3-4 weeks) and they drained out and couldn't recover.  Not sure, but I won't buy these again.  If anything, I'll probably stick with Eneloop rechargeables or give the regular (non-high capacity) AmazonBasics rechargeables in the future.

Evaluate and break in Amazon batteries not made in Japan before rushing to judgement

  I am fairly new to rechargeables and the first thing that jumps out at me is the cost of any brand with a decent reputation.  To me that means spending the money up front to get ""smart"" charging and evaluation equipment.  That reduces the chances of ruining new batteries, or worse yet ruining the devices being powered.  I purchased a Nitecore and and an Opus bt-c3100.  Quickly I learned to categorize 18650 batteries into three rough groups:  total scam batteries that should never be used because they barely put out any power and cannot hold a charge.  From reviews I have seen that means 400 mah hours or so from an 18650.  The second category is the extremely common ""knock-offs"" that copy, sometimes well and many times poorly, popular top performers and sell for much less.  These from what I have seen and from my own observations can  have power output of anywhere from 30% to 80% or so of the power of the tried and true name brand.I thought long and hard before purchasing the newest Amazon AA nimh high-capacity knowing they were not made in the Panasonic eneloop factory and were fairly pricey.  But I felt  it would be a good learning experience and for now I only power led flashlights and solar walkway lights.The first thing I did was read the directions!!!!!!! and it said charge at 250 mah.  The nitecore only goes down to 300 mah so I first discharged them on the Opus at 200 mah for 12 hours 20 minutes to 1-1.1 volts and all four(sorry no statistically significant data from this guy) gave off a measured 2440 or more mah , a little better than the rating of 2400 mah.  Charging at 200 mah took 13 hours and the cells absorbed 2570 mah , well above the 2400 rating.I will leave the discharge and power analysis to the electrical engineers with the knowledge, expertise, and software.  I will give my layman's opinion that initially these four Amazon high-capacity nimh batteries are  not fakes stuffed with sand and appear more promising to deliver  good service than the knock-offs that cut critical corners to keep the price down.  I recommend to other newbies to take the time to charge all rechargeables conservatively with a smart charger.  It is probably a good idea to first discharge and recharge these batteries even though mine came fully charged.  You would not take your brand new car and redline the engine out of the showroom.  Show you Amazon batteries the same care.  Maybe Amazon should offer detailed break-in instructions with all new rechargeable batteries.  That could help eliminate many of the bad experiences and bad reviews.

  There are only 3 US battery manufacturers.  The rest come from China or other Communist countries.  Durasmell batteries leak before the expiration date ALL THE TIME.  They also make Kirkland, and possibly these AMZ batteries.  You get what you pay for.  They also don't point out rechargeables are only 1.2VDC, NOT the normal 1.5VDC of regular alkaline batteries.  My advice: put these cheap batteries in some device that you don't care about throwing away when the acid leaks and eats up the conductive surface of the contacts and won't work ever again.

  Application: Panasonic cordless phonesNew, these batteries drained significantly faster than the original Panasonic batteries.  And after less than 1 year of service, they're only good for less than 3 hours of talk time or 1 day out of the charger.

Leaking Amazon Basics AAA High-Capacity Rechargeable Batteries (4-Pack)

  I purchased my AmazonBasics AAA High-Capacity Rechargeable Batteries (4-Pack) in August of 2018.  Rarely have I had to use all four (4) at the same time.  Upon receipt, I charged them, used two (2) for a flashlight, and placed the other two (2) back in the box since I wasn't sure if it was OK to leave on the charger.  My charger automatically shuts off when the battery is charged, but I didn't want to void the 1-Year Warranty.  A lot of good that decision did me.The pair of Amazon Basics AAA I Placed in my flashlight in June 2019 were weak, and I went to the box to get the other set to replace them.  I found both batteries had leaked.  There was a white powdery substance in the box as well as on the batteries themselves.  They were kept in a dry drawer with nothing which could have initiated a problem.  I have read reviews where others have had this issue, but I thought it a user issue, meaning they must have left them on the charger.I have other rechargeable batteries I've had for longer, Duracell and Energizer types, and they are STILL as good as the day I bought them.  Not one problem.  Since it's been now almost 15 months since my initial purchase, I doubt very seriously Amazon will make any exceptions.

  I have have been using theses batteries since I purchased them back in  Purchased November, 2018, and still work great for most things. I Purchased them primarily to use with some Tasco XR8 (400 lumen high powered) flashlights that I use when walking my dog at night. The flashlights were eating up three AAA batteries every week when used on high power. I can report that for flashlights these worked perfectly. They actually seem to work for a little longer than the standard one time use batteries (I can't remember if they were duracell or energizer) that came with the flashlight.After using 6 of the batteries for flashlights, I had 2 left over. So, I tried to uses these with the many Remote Controls we have around the house. But the batteries would not work with any remote controls, I even tried switching out the batteries with 2 of the 6 batteries that I had dedicated to flashlights, and they still would not work with any of the remote controls. They would not work with my Vizio TV remote control, they would not work with my Amazon Fire remotes, and they would not work with my Amazon Dash Wand.Therefore if you need a great set for rechargeable Flashlight batteries theses are my favorite, but if you are looking for batteries for your remote controls, I simply can not recommend these.PROs:Perfect for high powered flashlights.CONs:I could not get them to work with any of my remote controls.

  I bought both Amazon Basic 2400 @ $14.87 and Bonai 2300 @$13.49 -$2.00 coupon. I immediately ran the charge test ONCE on an Opur BT-C3400 charger which charges then discharge to determine capacity, then recharges @ 500mA. Bonai showed all slightly less than 2200mAh capacity and 1.40V fully charged. AMZ Basics showed slightly under or over 2400 mAh and 1.27V fully charged. So the AMZ Basics are stating real capacity, but I am not sure why there is a voltage diff between the brands. I'll have to run the test again after some use.Use tests have not been evaluated.

  I have more than 30 of these batteries. They perform well and seem to hold a charge. They run down faster than a traditional battery, but for non-dire situations, it is fine since there is virtually no cost to simply recharge them. Over the past 2 years 4 of these died and no longer take a charge. They are not heavily used and spend most of their time in remotes and low use electronics. This is the first rechargable battery brand that has suddenly failed for no apparent reason. I recharge these on an intelligent charger on the slowest charge setting to prolong battery life. Not sure if I would buy them again.

  I had some issues with these batteries recently, so I tried to refresh them with my

   charger. I bought these in May 27, 2018 and estimating that I have gone through a 10 cycles on each of the cycles would be generous, despite that most of them only recover to 85% of the labelled capacity and at least one only recovered to 65% of the claimed capacity. Upon closer inspection, they are Made in China and the manufacturing date was Nov 2011! It was my mistake to not check and refuse them when I received them, because my ""new"" batteries had been on the shelf for 6.5 years! I don't know of any NiMH manufacturer that claims a shelf life of longer than 5 years, so the deep discharge on the shelf probably damaged them irreparably. Never again!

  I have tried these batteries and I am not thrilled.  First thing, my wife has these LED lights and the batteries do not even work at all.  I have been using Panasonic Eneloop batteries and they work perfectly in these lights.  It seems that the positive contact in the Amazon batteries does not stick out as far as Alkaline or the Panasonic batteries and therefore won't make contact with the contacts in the lights.  The Amazon batteries work well with flashlights and such.  I have used them in my Apple Trackpad and they work but don't seem to work very long, I had to replace them after a week.  I have charged the a few times since they arrived but they don't seem to last as long as the Panasonic.  I will keep using them and see if the life gets longer and will let you know.  I am not impressed.

  I tried these batteries in my solar dock lights. My solar lights are off while the battery charges during the day and then they turn on and stay lit from dusk until dawn.  The previous batteries I had were able to keep the dock lights lit all night long until they finally died (about 2 years of use).  These Amazon batteries were only able to keep the lights on all night for about 2 days. After that, the stay lit time dropped dramatically.  After about 1 month of use, the lights will only stay lit for about 2-3 hours.  Even worse, on some days, 1-2 of my lights won’t light up at all.These batteries are junk.  Also, please note that these batteries are slightly fatter (bigger around) compared to normal size AA batteries.  I had a little bit of difficulty getting them to fit in the battery compartments due to the bigger size.

  I have an ever expanding collection of items that take AA & AAA batteries.  I currently have quite a few Eneloop batteries that have worked quite well, but are expensive.  After reading some reviews, I decided to give these a chance.  Despite having 850mhh capacity, they last about 1 day, where the 750mhh Eneloop batteries last about 4-6.Initially I thought it may have been the charger, but after replacing the charger, using both another new charger, as well as the same charger I've used for years with the Eneloop, I think these batteries are no good.  Don't waste your time or money on them.

  Can't comment on longevity yet, but the batteries may have a problem with making connection with battery contacts in certain devices.  The terminals do not stick out proud enough to make contact to all devices, such as my PC mouse.  The high insulated shoulder on the ""+"" terminal side hangs up on the socket of the Mouse and makes intermittent contact, if at all.  Compare to the Enerloop which has very clean shoulders, leaving plenty of terminal standing proud. Haven't decide yet to return them or try to modify to get rid of a few mils of thickness; or bend the mouse contact out more so it makes consistent contact.

","

  These batteries have not changed their advertising; but they have changed the country of origin.  These Amazon Basics batteries have gone through some changes  Started out as black with green leaf motif.  They were made in Japan, and their claimed capacity was the same as the Sanyo eneloop.  And about the time that Panasonic put their logo onto eneloop batteries Amazon Basics became grey with a thin green line circle at the top.  They had an electrical signature very similar to the eneloop which have become the “gold standard “ in terms of quality.  I have both AB and Panasonic batteries, and they meet and exceed their claimed capacities.  The main difference is that the Panasonic eneloop batteries are substantially more expensive.When I receive new batteries, I don’t care if they come “precharged “ or not.  Instead I put them through a couple of renew cycles.  I’v noticed that the capacity of the batteries increase after two sometimes three discharge test or renew cycles.When I bought some more AB rechargeables,  they were still grey, but the green circle at the top was wider than before.  And I found that one or two didn’t quite meet the claimed capacity on the first refresh cycle.  On the subsequent cycles, they met/exceeded their capacity expectations.  Upon using this newest incarnation of Amazon Basics rechargeable high capacity AA,I noticed that they needed to be recharged just a bit sooner than the previous generation.  Probably would not have noted the difference had it not been for the difference when initially charging, discharging, etc in the battery charger analyzers renew cycles.  That is when I used a magnifying glass and read Made in China on the batteries.I don’t know exactly when Jeff Bezos and co decided to charge his sourcing for manufacturing his brand. Just wanted to pass on that these Amazon Basics high capacity AA and AAA batteries are still good batteries.  That said, the Japanese made batteries are better than the ones made by the Chinese.Just to add that to charge and renew the batteries, I use the Accupower IQ 338 XL and the Opus BT 3400.

Long-Lasting Battery Life
","

  I’ve been slowly (very slowly) converting my house to be more self-sustaining.  As such, I’m taking small steps and one of the steps is using battery-operated sensor lights to illuminate my basement.  The lights I use (AMIR Motion Sensor Light https://amzn.to/2B3wjHu ) take three AAA batteries each.  The motion sensor lights come in packs of six.  That means I need 18 batteries for each light pack (as I said, this is a slow transition).Initially, I purchased one eight-pack of the Amazon Basics high-capacity rechargeables and bought copper-topped batteries for the remaining lights.  What I noticed was the copper-topped batteries wore out much quicker than the rechargeables. The rechargeables lasted two to three times longer (if not more) than the non-rechargeables.  I quickly realized I was being penny wise and pound foolish by purchasing non-rechargeable batteries, so now I only buy the rechargeable. They really are high capacity batteries.I’ve dabbled with other brands of rechargeable batteries, but have found that these not only last the longest, but seem to recharge quicker. In the long run, they’re not only more economical, but better on the environment. The packaging is mostly cardboard, except for the plastic shrink wrap.  The plastic uses recycle code 1 which is purportedly one of the safer and easier to recycle categories of plastic.All in all, I’m very happy with these batteries.  BTW, I’ve been recharging the batteries using the  EBL Smart 8 Bay AA AAA battery recharger ( https://amzn.to/2Vy1NyJ ) and couldn’t be happier.

  These batteries are supposed to be rechargeable, but they don't recharge reliably or hold a charge. Even when used in low-intensity devices like flashlights, they only last a short time. I had rechargeable batteries 25 years ago that lasted longer than these do. What a waste of money.

  Product worked well for the first 2 months but then the battery following those months instead of a 4-5 day battery life it dropped to barley 1 day (Note: Batteries were used for an Xbox One Controller) It was probably my fault for leaving it on the charger for longer than needed or just natural decay of the battery over time due multiple recharges and discharges but that shows how cheap the materials in the battery are and the only really good thing about the product is the price!

Good deal but major caveat...
","

  From the looks of the other reviews, these batteries change from time to time.  Mine are the currenlty pictured ones with grey sides and green highlights at the ends.  I knocked two stars off because they are ever so slightly bigger than a standard AA alkaline battery.  This matters when fitting them and removing them from my charger, and worse, they are REALLY hard to get in/out of certain devices I have (which fit standard AA alkaline batteries perfectly).  Keep that in mind when considering these if your alkaline batteries fit snugly into your device.  The batteries do work and they seem to hold a charge well when charged with my better-than-average charger.  The AAA version of these seem to have the same ""slightly too big"" problem as well.  Despite the caveat, I think this is a good deal for 8 rechargeable batteries (and the AAA 8-packs) and I'm using them in quite a few devices with success.

Amazon bait and switch - avoid China made not Japan as photo shows
","

  As a prime member I've been buying Amazon basics batteries for quite some time and the batteries themselves have AWLAYS matched the description and the photos until now. The last two orders have been different from the photos and are not longer made in Japan (as one of the photos show) but China. Worse the design of the battery has also changed (again different than photos) and the positive lug is shorter and doesn't always make good contact. Lastly the performance isn't as good either. I understand ""packaging may vary"" and I'm okay with the packaging looking different but NOT the battery itself, how / where its made and its performance. That is either bait and switch or now Amazon has a problem with its own batteries being counterfeit. I'm quite disappointed in Amazon and when I called to inform them of this they didn't even provide some sort of courtesy compensation or explanation. Time to go back to Eneloop batteries.

OK for average use but inadequate for professional photography

  I'm a wedding photographer and have used eneloops for years.  I've been very happy with the Panasonic Eneloop Pro but thought I'd give these Amazon Basics a try because of the price.  They worked fine in the prep shots were there was a several second pause between flashes.  During other portions of a wedding, however,  I found that the flash didn't recharge quickly enough and about about 50% of the shots of the wedding party walking down the aisle the flash didn't fire.  Very disappointing.  It also seemed to run out of juice a little sooner than the Panasonic Eneloop Pro.  All of this is just anecdotal and I don't really have the ability to perform scientific tests but my experience has been below expectations for professional use.  For the average family user, I think they would probably work great and you can't beat the price.Best of luck!

Excellent NIMH battery
","

  I had a bunch of another brand, and about a year after buying them, they started to die on me.  I go out at nite a lot, and tend to use my headlamp a lot. So I tend to be an extreme user of  rechargeable batteries. But with the current set nearing their charge limit, I was kinda stunned. They lasted just a year. I have other brands that have lasted years longer. So I wasn't going back to buy that brand. They should last more then a year, even at my rate of usage. So I got this time  Amazon branded NiMH batteries. They are made in Japan. They are sent to you as nearly as I can tell fully changed, or very near it. My smart charger immediately kicked them back as ready to go. They produce a lot of power, and they tend to keep going for a long time before they need recharged. All pro's. In fact, from a power output, to a longevity of the battery, I really can't tell any difference between these and the top (expensive) name brands. And they are a fraction of the cost. I haven't had them long enough to judge durability. But in the initial charges, they all work out to the same amount of time in my potent Cree powered headlamp (it sucks power like there's no tomorow lol).  My only complaint here is it's TOUGH getting them out of their plastic shrink wrap. If you don't have a tool, you better have some pretty strong fingers. However, that's not worth a star. But be warned, that shrink wrap is not easy to break open.  But other then that, the batteries are just as good as the top name brands. And they are solar charged. Can't beat that.

  I've been using these AAA batteries for such a wide array of things since I've gotten them... controllers, computer mice, laser pointers, etc. They all still work and hold their charge for as long as they did when I first got them. It's been a while, but even though they came pre-charged, I still let them charge overnight before using them anyway. They charge fast and get the job done, and AmazonBasics offers prices that are hard to beat when compared to the other competitors on the market.

Not great compared to regular AA batteries
","

  I am making a comparison with these batteries compared to other rechargeables I own (18650 various brands) and Duracell's Procell (non-rechargeable) that I normally use.I am using a nitecore charger to charge my batteries. It is compatible with various types of batteries, the 18650 and AA's in particular.The device I am using these in is my bluetooth controllers for my Windows Mixed Reality headset.The only reason I bought these batteries for my two controllers (two AA each) is because the procell's I've been using only lasts two days and I thought that was terrible. Well, these are worse. And might be even worse depending on how long they last until they can't charge anymore due to the how often I got to charge them.So here are my cons:1) Longevity of the charge. It is very short, don't even last 3 hours of constant use until the batteries die. The procell's I normally use last me two days of use. Comparing it to my LG 18650 batteries (which are 3000mAh) which are used in vape products, and my cree led flashlight, which seem to last week at high usage. The 18650's are high discharge batteries, so I'm not sure if these Amazon AA's are with that comparison.2) Cost, due to longevity and other batteries I use, these are the most expensive per life of a charge. I bought the 8 pack due to I need 4 for my controllers (2 each) and then another 4 ready to go.3) Heat. Normally if you batteries get hot during, or during charging, then that is a really bad thing. The 18650 batteries have a chance to explode. So I'm not sure if these will get to that point too, but during use they are getting warm to the touch. During charging almost too hot to handle.The batteries do say ""Made in japan"" printed on the label, which was the only reason I bought them.I'll need to buy some other AA Ni-MH to compare with, but for now I am not impressed and won't be buying anymore of these from Amazon.

  Bought these after a bad run with Eneloops, and the same thing happened with these. Well not exactly the same but close enough to try another brand.  Basically the Eneloops and Amazon AA were only usable for about a year of daily use. Today all 4 AA batteries are dead even after a full charge. I switched to rayovac since they have been giving me the best long term use.

  These are very good batteries, but a very poor value. They cost $17.49 for an eight pack, (which is a price drop of over $2) which is about $2.19 a battery and put out an average of a little over 2450 mAh of current. Which is very good since they are rated at 2400 mAh. That is still only 1114 mAh per dollar.

  batteries only last about 2 hours if you're lucky. You constantly have to keep changing out batteries, while another set is charging. You end up destroying all your headlamps, and flashlights from opening and closing to change out battery three four times a day.

  Originally bought 2 sets of these batteries(March 2017) thinking Amazon Basics would be a good choice. And I will say that for 5 months they did work well. Unfortunately, some of these started to sometimes fail in that they would no longer charge but I still thought 'okay, things happen' and contacted Amazon and got 8 replacements sent out in December 2017. We put those into use removing the 'bad' ones and we limped along for a few months. Within a few months we started seeing sporadic failures again to where I started to doubt the charger.I started doing research on the charger and rechargeable batteries in general and came across an article(sorry don't have the link) talking about the cells coming from China and those coming from Japan and of course how the ones from Japan are under stricter regulations about quality. At this point, I purchased a set of Panasonic Eneloop  batteries in April 2018 and still have all 16 in use with no issues charging as of this writing in June 2019!For anyone curious we are using these to power wireless mic transmitters in our church. We use 10(random) of the 16 on Sunday mornings for approximately 4hrs and then they go back on the charger and then we use 8(random) of the 16 on Thursday nights for rehearsal and they go back on the charger.

  I was skeptical that these would be like the cheap Radio Shack batteries I was once sucked into buying. They didn't last at all but these are working out really well and they seem to hold their charge well when not being used.I use them in several devices around the house and I have more than twice as many as I need in the devices. So I charge the extras up and have them ready for when they are needed. Then I just swap an already charged set for the old set and charge the old ones. The charged cells can sit around for a month or more but do not seem to loose any significant charge while waiting. Very happy with these.

These batteries are saving me lots of money AND they last.

  A couple of years ago I bought a charger and set of rechargeable batteries and started using them  Then I started running out and having to use standard batteries. Then I ordered these so I don't have to wait for a set to charge.  Why?  Good alkalines last a long time but when they're dead that's it. Discard and buy more.  These batteries get changed out so I don't have to buy more batteries, I just recharge them.  So far, based on the cost of good alkalines, I've saved the cost of the charger and the batteries that I ordered with it. In another six chargings I'll have saved the cost of these batteries.  The math is unassailable and I get to keep the savings.  What's so bad about that?NOTE: Things like smoke alarms and other safety items should still get Alkalines since they are designed to use alkalines.  Otherwise, use rechargables: no waste, no ""Dead"" batteries when you need them, and best, no cost for replacement.  What's not to like?

  First of all these batteries do not arrive fully charged. It took me a full 2 hours in my re-charger to get them to 100% capacity. But once they were fully charged, they worked amazingly.

BUYER BEWARE, HAZARDOUS BATTERIES
","

  So because Amazon banned the sale of 18650, 3.7v batteries I had to resort to buying AAA batteries for my flashlights. Ever since I bought my first flashlight on here I've dealt with 18650 batteries (and trust me, I've bought many flashlights on here) but this is a first on me dealing with rechargable AAA batteries. I thought I would buy from Amazon basics because Amazon is reliable right? WRONG!I unboxed these and within 10 seconds of me putting them in the battery holder, the light itself didn't turn on so I started troubleshooting and as soon as I touched the batteries to bring them out, I burned my finger and what followed was a smell of burst batteries. I recognize the smell because a year ago I had a portable power bank that had burst and filled my room with a terrible chemical smell. Anyways, I also noticed some smoke coming from the batteries and soon realized what had happened. The batteries got so hot that they melted the plastic part of the battery holder. Needless to say I'm very disappointed because I thought these were going to be good rechargable batteries and wow, I got burned. Literally. What really gets on my nerves is that Amazon doesn't have a button anywhere which allows me to contact the seller or anything. So here I am, writing this review in hopes that they see this and contact meBUYER BEWARE OF THESE HAZARDOUS BATTERIES

  Someone here said the Amazon AA High-caps were basically the Eneloop batteries repackaged/rebranded. Not really sure about that but I've used mine for well over a year in my camera flashes and they've been very reliable. The older ones don't hold as much of a charge and but that's understandable, as long as I full charge a set of 4 batteries I can get through a 100~ 150 full powered shots even after a year. I've brought more to phase out older ones.

  I dont usually write reviews anymore because I am always suspicious of bad reviews, however I have had several brands of rechargeable AA batteries and these batteries from Amazon did not stand the test of time. Some were dead within days, others lasted only a few weeks, and now after 6 months there are two left out of a pack of 12. That should give you and idea. I use them primarily for battery powered candles. There are other brands out there so read the reviews and you will find them, but like anything it is a learning curve.

  These batteries are 1.2 volts.  Standard AA and AAA batteries have always been 1.5 volts.  If you are in series with two or three batteries then you are starting off at low voltage.

4 dead after 1-year - watch the mR value. Still a good value.
","

  I bought an 8-pack of AA's in May of 2018.  My Zanflare charger consistently showed over 2500mAHrs.  I used 4 of them in my camera charging every month or so.  They worked great in my camera - longest lasting rechargeable I ever had.  The other 4 were used in a radio which I used daily.  I charged the batteries every other day, so maybe 150 charges.You can see the difference between the two sets in my photo.  The camera set shows that the mR (battery internal resistance) value after 1-year as 65mOhm, which the value when the batteries are new.  The set that I used in the radio (and charged frequently) shows a value of 148-644 mOhms all the recharges.  That set had trouble powering the radio with those high mR value - sometimes it could not turn on.  The batteries have a 1-year warranty and amazon honored the warranty by replacing all 8 batteries.I also have a set of AAA's which I use in my remote controls and have had no issues with them at all.I am still giving these batteries 4 stars because 1) the capacity was great, 2) they were still a good value compared to alkalines even if I would have had to replace them 3) Amazon honored their warranty, so I have 8 new batteries.Bottom line.  I will continue to buy these batteries.  I recommend you use a charger that displays the mR value so you can monitor the battery health.  If you have issues, return them for replacement before the 1-year expires.

  I bought these Amazon Basics to replace Duracell rechargeable batteries which lasted ten years. Their only use was for Xbox controllers. Within a couple of months, the controller would randomly lose connectivity to the Xbox even though the batteries were just fully charged.I have since controlled for using a headset vs. not, tried these batteries in four different controllers, and connected the controllers to two different Xbox's...all resulting in the same issue. I've tested normal batteries in those same controllers and had no problems.

  We have horses with limited electricity in the barn so we use headlamps for tending to them at night. After charging the batteries the output is comparable to the Duracells we've been using. A few 20 minute uses and they seem to lose about 50% of their power and our lamps operate like they've been set to LOW.  They do seem to hold a charge for good length of time however.

  Initially, I really liked these batteries.  They were reasonably priced and seemed to work just fine in the TV remotes and LED convenience lights I used them in.  Unfortunately,  as I continued to use them and installed them in more devices, it became clear that they had to be replaced and recharged far more frequently than single-use batteries and they don’t work at all in some devices.  Anything with a motor as the primary load won’t even turn on.If you don’t mind recharging the batteries in the remote control every other month, these batteries are a pretty good deal.  If you need batteries for your Amope electronic foot file, buy some Duracells.

  Used these for my Xbox One controller for about two months, on and off. They started out great, lasting about two weeks before needing to be recharged. Then all of a sudden they started needing to be recharged daily, and now they wont even turn my controller on. I didn't start using the controller a crazy amount or anything like that either. Normal batteries work fine, so these just decided to stop holding a charge. Probably more worth it to just buy a pack of AA batteries for the price, wouldn't really recommend. May work fine for things that dont take much battery, such as a remote for a TV.

Most of my rechargeables are Eneloop batteries, these were purchased because they are a bit less expensive and I wanted to see how they worked. Others seem to have have good success based on the reviews. These were purchased initially for some led candles my wife purchased. The main problem I found with these batteries is that the positive terminal doesn't protrude far enough and depending on the device may not actually touch the terminal. This may also be a fault with the device's design but I have not experienced this with the Eneloop batteries and holding the batteries side by side there is a barely discernable difference. It is slight and I was able to remediate it by trimming the outer wrap from the battery but I'm not sure that is a good solution. As long as they work in your device they should perform well.

  Well these batteries appear to be quite good.  Put one in a phone that worked for over an hour when new and when it went down to 15 minutes replaced and now you can talk way over an hour and there is still have the bars left.  Very Impressive.  It will take time for word to get out but it will.....

  I got tired of my son going through batteries like there is an endless supply of them. I bought these and the charging station for him.  These batteries were subjected to pretty much continuous use and lasted for a little over a year.  They no longer charge no matter how long they’re on the charging station. They saved me money overall and I will be purchasing another set for him.

  This was my first attempt at utilizing rechargeable batteries. I noticed right away a huge improvement how long these batteries last! Using standard batteries( you know, the kind you can buy in bulk at COSTCO) in my LED light I have in my shower. I had to replace these batteries every 2 to 3 weeks. I got tired and decided to try the Amazon Basics rechargeable batteries. I think I even noticed right away that the LED lights were brighter! These batteries lasted 7 weeks! I hear that I am going to loose some of this initial performance with subsequent charges. So far so Good!!

  This is for the AAA 8 pack - batteries came pre-charged but the initial charge was low and they ran out of juice quickly. A normal charge was put on them, and they ran really well thru a charge/discharge cycle and run just as long as my enloops. I was told these are often the rebranded version of them anyway - I dont know for sure but they have the same battery life and quality so far.

  The price point for these rechargeable batteries is what draws me to them.  These are a second set I have.  Thus far I have had no issues with recharging them on a base I already own and they seem to be fairly durable. I use these in  in various electronics and toys and I found them to be cost effective as certain toys were quick battery drainers and I used to be out purchasing more until I made the switch to rechargeable.  The biggest cost outlay will be for the batteries and a charger but in the long run you definitely save money and reduce your carbon footprint too.

  I do a LOT of video and photo work and the amount of batteries I go through in a short period is amazing.  I was looking for quality high capacity rechargeable batteries at what I consider as reliable and not as expensive.  These AmazonBasics AAA are doing the job as well as any of the higher priced Name Brands.  They are lasting as long as the ""others"" and recharge rather quickly.  Good buy, and probably will become my standard going forth.  If anything goes south, I will update, but for now, they are good to go.

  With a capacity of only 850 mAh, I consider these batteries too inadequate for what they cost.  EBL and a few other companies make AAA Ni-MH with capacities of 1100 mAh (a 22% increase) with that cost only a little more than these.As with all rechargeable batteries, make sure you are using a good charger, one that you can adjust how quickly the batteries charge as well as give you a readout of the voltage of the battery as well as the actual number of mAh used to fully recharge the battery.  The Opus BT-C2400 has cords for both AC and DC charging but my favorite is the Opus BT-C2000 as it has adapters to allow charging of C & D size batteries in addition to AAA/AA.

I bought these for my son’s RC car so that I would not throw my hard earned money down the drain buying batteries...guess I was wrong. Because of this I will no longer buy any Amazon Basic items.

Best Rechargeable Batteries I’ve Owned.
","

  First off, I’m reviewing the AmazonBasics High-Capacity Rechargeable Batteries.I’ve owned  9v, AA, and AAA AmazonBasics High-Capacity Rechargeable Batteries for about a year and a half and in that time I’ve had absolutely no issues whatsoever. I use a EBL–999 charger which charges all three types of batteries I’ve purchased from Amazon. I’ve used these batteries with several flashlights and various other electronic devices without any problems. I’m a musician and I also depend on the 9v’s for several effects pedals on my board when performing live music. It’s tough to explain what can happen at a live gig when your signal cuts out. Yeah, it’s obviously a disaster when something goes wrong that should never happen in this day and age, but leave it to live muaic to expose every weak link in an artist’s or band’s setup. In a word, it’s “chaos”.I am very happy to report that I’ve had zero issues with these batteries and they’ve paid for themselves a dozen times over – at a minimum.I highly recommend these AmazonBasics High-Capacity Rechargeable Batteries to anyone looking to save money on batteries.My only regret is the coin I spent on batteries before I purchased these...what a grand waste of money it is to buy non–rechargeable batteries, whether you use them as often as I do or not. Any way you look at it, this is one purchase you’ll never regret.I cannot speak to the negative reviews here as I have yet to  experience anything of the sort.This is a fantastic product all around and I highly recommend it.

I use this light At LEAST 5-6 times a night for taking the dog out, going to the car, and even indoors when looking into dark cabinets and such. I get three weeks to a month between swapping Eneloops. I bought these thinking that is was a better deal, but I'm swapping batteries with these weekly.They work well enough, but they just don't have the longevity of the better brand. I use these on cheap flashlights with no current regulators because they are cheap enough that I don't care if they burn up. For that reason, I have purchased a second batch. They are rechargables which are cheap enough to be disposed of if necessary.

  Batteries do not hold charge. I invested pretty heavily in AA and AAA rechargeable batteries from Amazon. After approximately a year- i find nearly every one of the batteries are not recharging, or are losing charge extremely fast. I'm having to replace my remote batteries every month, as opposed to every 4 months. Lots of similar anecdotal examples... Don't get me wrong- for the year i've used them- they saved me money...but i won't be reinvesting in these again.

  Decent for the price, but I don't know that these batteries stand up to their rated amp hour capacity. I only get one to two work days out of my headlamp with these batteries where I would get about a week from alkaline. These DO NOT come fully charged, and I have a few that hold less of a charge than others, so quality control is lacking. I had high hopes, these are reviewed well and showed well in testing online. But I might tend toward spending the money for eneloop next time.

  I originally thought these were good batteries. But after 2 charges, they stopped charging. They came with the amazon charger and every time I try and charge them it flashes red indicating a bad battery. I tried throwing some really old energizer rechargeables in the charger and they worked fine. I strongly do not recommend these batteries. These are actually a replacement that I got after the first batch did the same exact thing.

  I've been using rechargeable batteries for a few years now - it's basically all I have in my house at this point.  We go through quite a bit of AAs because my 3 kids love the video games and the controllers go through batteries quite frequently.  I have 2 chargers charging 8 batteries at all times and probably another 12 that are constantly being used.  The batteries are switched out frequently and after more than a year I can't tell a difference in their power or longevity.  Actually, the only batteries I have that I feel are getting weak are the original batteries that came with my charger and have a little pink bunny on the side.  I am extremely happy with these batteries and will continue to purchase these rechargeable cylinders of awesome from now on.

  I'm using them in LED lights in my kitchen. They don't get used that often. I've only charged them ALL twice total. However, random batteries within the pack are just dying off and not holding charge. It seems to be progressive because now, even more batteries are experiencing these problems. Regular batteries lasted about a year. These will only last a month or so of very little use before needing recharging. I think they're just discharging on their own, which is bad. Quality control seems to be lacking on these.

  Initially these batteries were nearly identical to the Eneloop batteries. Recently this has changed. New batteries will have minimum life, little to no storage ability and consistent low voltage.These used to last for months in remotes and bluetooth keyboards, etc. The new versions give me 3 weeks at best. Charged batteries that are stored lose their charge at a very high rate as well. I would count on 1 month of storage. Even at full charge the batteries often cannot get to the full 1.2V that the specification says. This has been tested across multiple batches.I loved these, but the quality is just gone now.

Gave 2 stars because THEY DO NOT FIT in a normal battery compartment for AA batteries
","

  I bought both the AA and AAA battery packs and thought I would give them a try.  They seemed to be a good value BUT I Gave them only 2 stars because THEY DO NOT FIT in a normal battery compartment for AA batteries. They would not fit in 5 different items such as our electric toothbrushes, pedicure sander, etc.  We FINALLY found an item that they would fit in which was our battery operated CANDLES.  The fat candles with timers for xx number of hours on and auto turn off.  The battery compartment in the candles was large enough to accommodate the batteries BUT NONE of the other items would fit the batteries so as some of the other reviewers may have said they are SLIGHTLY Larger if you have a tight fit battery compartment.  It seems that the ""covering"" on the battery extends longer on the bottom and you can't remove or trim it to get them to fit in tight battery compartments.  So I will NOT be purchasing any more of these.  Soooo disappointed : (  Can't speak to the life of the battery as I have not had them long enough to have input on that.  Would not recommend due to the ""fit"" issue.

I've tested them, and so far, they are as advertised!
","

  First, read the top-rated review from NLee the Engineer, and then go look at his reviews for comparable batteries for some background.I've owned and used 4th-generation standard Eneloop batteries for several years, but it's only been in the past year that I got more serious about looking into different brands and testing for Ni-MH rechargeable batteries.  First, if you're only knowledge of rechargeable batteries is the NiCad versions from the 90's, modern rechargeables are MUCH better than that.  In fact, while they start off at a slightly lower charge than 1.5V alkalines, alkalines quickly burn off that charge and continue to do so, to the point where 1.25V Ni-MH batteries actually output more voltage after about 30 minutes of use, and often remain usable for longer.Sanyo/Panasonic's Eneloop brand was a pioneer of the Ni-MH battery in the late 2000's, and some of those early versions still perform quite well by current standards.  A typical capacity for a ""standard"" Eneloop is around 1900-2000 mAh.  But there are increasingly ""high-capacity"" Ni-MH batteries that claim even higher capacities - perhaps 2300 (EBL), 2400 (Amazon High-Capacity), 2600 (Mr. Batt), or even 2800 mAh (EBL, again).Based on testing results and circumstantial evidence collected by consumers, it appears likely that many (but not all) of the original AmazonBasics rechargeable were simply re-branded models of early-version Eneloops.  This ""high-capacity"" version, then appears to be re-brand (or at least a functional equivalent) of the Eneloop XX model, which was later named the ""Eneloop Pro"".I tested capacity with an OPUS BT-C2000 Charger/Analyzer.  You do this by charging the battery fully, then discharging it fully, while the BT-C2000 measures the amount of power discharged until it is ""empty"".  The results for the Amazon High-Capacity brand were as good (or better than advertised).  For the 8 AA batteries I tested, the capacity ranged from 2357 to 2404 mAH - a remarkably narrow window reflecting good quality control.  For the 4 AAA batteries I tested, the range was 826 to 856 mAh - impressive given that the packaging indicates only a ""minimum of 800 mAh"".I think unless you are looking at using them in digital cameras or other very high-drain devices, the high-capacity rechargeables probably are not a necessity, and investing in a good stable of standard Ni-MH batteries is a better investment.  But for a much better price than the Eneloop Pro's, these AmazonBasics High-Capacity batteries seem to be the real deal.NOTE: I will update my post over time if I notice any significant changes in their performance.  Note that I did not do any testing for ""self-discharge"" rate, another metric for rechargeables relating to how quickly they lose power ""on the shelf"".

These batteries don't hold a charge!
","

  I purchased both AA and AAA sizes of these batteries to use in flameless candles with timers. These batteries are horrible!! They lasted for 15 hours, 3 days of use, and needed to be recharged. Four of them were in the charger all day and over night and we're still not recharged. I have been using the black Amazon Basics AA and AAA batteries for about 6 months and they are okay but don't hold a charge as well as the Duracel and Energizers I have. Rechargeable batteries are not cheap. I don't mind paying for them if they last, it's definately worth it. But these are rip off!! I would return them but no longer have the packaging they came in. I'm really disappointed and disgusted! An addendum: I neglected to mention that I charged the batteries before I used them for the first time.Edit 1/8/2019: My problem has been resolved. Amazon quickly responded to my issue. I received a full refund as well as a replacement of batteries. Thanks!!

  We bought these 2-years ago, used in a remote-controlled race car set.  They lasted a long time, recharged fine, then we put the race cars away for a while, the batteries drained, then I was left with 6 batteries that would not recharge.  The cars were left on, so apparently, if you run these down to zero and let them sit, they are dead.  However, I left them on my La Crosse charger for a while and they started charging!  Back to racing..Note - Warranty is only 1-year, Amazon's support center sends you to a dead end for over 1-year.

  I have not purchased these but after reading some reviews these sound like nothing more than rebranded EBL batteries, which I HAVE purchased. (The dead giveaway are the complaints of the battery diameter being slightly larger than standard, thus making them hard to fit into certain devices. This is one of the very issues with EBL.) The EBL batteries have a horrible shelf life and lose a ton of capacity if not used/recharged frequently. That said, their initial capacity is generous, about 30% more than many others.

  These batteries have been working pretty much as well as others I have bought, as far as I can tell, but they are slightly larger around than others.I have found that with one item that uses them it's hard to get them in and out, and it scarred one of them a bit.

  Purchased 16 batteries and every one arrived 12/22/18 half charged. I decided to charge 2 out of each pack on a new high end charger/tester. When done all 4 tested between 746 and 913mah... these are supposed to be 2400mAh!?!?! I'm going to check more but it does not look good.

  I have several versions of Amazon rechargeable batteries.  I have always loved Amazon products and I was a big fan when I first bought the batteries. I mainly use these in all of my LED candles that I have all over my house on timers.  Unfortunately, they just don’t last very long before they die and need to be recharged. Even worse, they are now no longer taking a charge at all.  I can’t tell you how many I have had to throw away. Sad and upsetting.  I can’t say that I would recommend buying them and as much money as I have spent buying them...I would not purchase them again!

  Plastic cover on ouside of battery comes off with time. Charge begins to dwindle to nothing very quickly.

  Worst purchase I have made, I had high hopes for this product, since it is supposedly made in Japan, marked as High Capacity. After half an hour in my headlamp, batteries died. Charged longer than eneloop, than used them again to see the same result. Cheap batteries from Bjs Wholesales last a lot longer, and they are throw away alkalines. I regret paying so much and getting worthless items

  I would have given these a 3 because of their charged-life, but the price is good and better than throwing disposables out or having to recycle them. I would say these last about 1/3 of the life of a Duracell in an XBox controller, so the return on investment is probably a year for us. Sticking one of these in a device that lasts a few years just doesn't ever seem like it would be worth doing so...

Be careful, these  batteries are larger than regular AA batteries
","

  These batteries will work in most devices, but they are fatter than regular AA batteries.  I have some Maglite flashlights where the batteries will not fit.  Regular AA batteries or other brands of rechargeables slide right into these flashlights, but the Amazon ones won't even go into the tube.  I would be afraid to use these in a device where the batteries go in with some tightness because I might not be able to get them out again. Devices where the batteries just go into a slot would probably be fine.

  I found that in the initial year of use, these performed pretty well in terms of discharge and recharge rates.  But into 2 years of ownership, I've found their capacity has dropped.

  These Batteries are not durable enough for me. I’ve had them a couple of years and charged them 10 to 15 times. Now they are completely gone. Will not charge on any of my chargers. I have multiple high end chargers so that is not the issue. These cannot be Eneloops rebranded. I still have Eneloops from 2009 that have been cycled 100s of times and still charge to capacity. Bottom line don’t buy. I bought some of the regular capacity Amazon rechargeable batteries which used to be White now they are Black. I have not had any issue with them yet. So I would say they are probably ok.

  i am re-writing this review because it is far worse than i thought originallyi got these to save some cash on batteries for my VR headset controllers... unfortunately the controllers tell me that these batteries are on the brink of death after a full charge. the batteries will only last around 2 hours tops before quitting.i also found that after a couple days part of one of the batteries started peeling away.the last straw for me was- after months of using these i decided to try some energizers in my controllers and low and behold: it registered a full charge and i was able to play for more than 2 hours. i honestly cant even see these being useful in something as low power as a TV remote.

  I was a little iffy about getting them since I’ve been using energizer rechargeable for many years on gaming controllers but I figured only one way to find out and for the price it was definitely worth a shot and I’m quite impressed I’d say my controller with a gaming headset hooked as well it will probably get 8 hours being on before I have to grab another set which is good considering I swap the batteries once a week maybe and the energizers maybe every 5 days

  Surprisingly, these Rechargeable Batteries charge to only 1.4 volts and would not work on my Medical Electric Stimulator.
