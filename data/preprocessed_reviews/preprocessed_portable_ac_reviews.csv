65,B01DLPUWL2,"Size: 14,000 BTU","August 23, 2020",Verified Purchase,Cost effective for limited use,"  This unit provides very good cold air and does what I need it to do.  Out of the box, the control were not working properly perhaps due to not letting it sit for 24 hrs per the instructions.  The seal for the window vent is not very good - I needed to put some painter’s tap around the edges to keep bugs/flys out.  Draining the unit also was not too good - had to significantly tilt the unit to get water out of the drainage port, but that caused some water leakage higher up the unit near the handles so not sure what’s going on there.  All that said, this unit is powerful and blows nice cold air enough to keep a larger size room comfortable.  I have a town house with high ceilings - 16 ft with exposure to the hall access to the upper bedrooms and I can feel A/C in that hall.

The warmer days it got about 75-80 in our apartment, coming from the south it was bearable (with some fans).As we began the heat wave in CA, our apartment was sitting at 85-95 degrees and was horrible. No amount of fans fixed it, and our windows are bay style, so a traditional window AC was not an option.I decided to take the plunge and get this AC and am SO HAPPY I did. It has cooled down our bedroom to the point where we can actually get a good nights sleep for the first time in a what feels like forever. I seriously cannot recommend it enough.A few more notes:- I did not use the included windows panel, so I can’t speak to how good that is- We have a relatively small room, about 150sqft, and it works beautifully, but I can’t speak to how good it would be in a larger room- I let the unit sit for 24 hrs before use, so if you don’t do that, I’m not sure how good your experience will be.

92,B01DLPUWL2,"Size: 8,000 BTU","August 20, 2020",Verified Purchase,Overall pretty good product,"  I bought this to cool my mobile home during the summer. I expected it to be very noisy but it's no louder than our dehumidifier which is not too bad. If we are watching TV, two notches up on the volume is plenty. I live in a very humid climate so I have never used it as a dehumidifier,  I already have one. For cooling it does a great job. We have approximately 400 square feet we needed to keep cool and it did a wonderful job. So well in fact that I didn't need fans on in the other rooms far away from the air conditioner because the cool air circulates enough. It did make the room more humid because of the self evaporation but if you run a separate dehumidifier at night it is really no big deal. It cooled a much larger area than advertised as long as you don't need it below 72 in your home. Power wise I ran it about 20-30 hours a week depending on temperature and it cost about 30 dollars for the month. I would consider that pretty decent.  The window panel fits perfectly into windows that open to the side like mine do. A small piece of advice, put a little bit of duct tape on the part where the hose attaches so it doesn't pop off every time you move it.

I went from using one fan to using 2 fans and after finally giving in, decided to buy a personal a/c for me and now I'm down to no fans.I live in Florida where it's hot all year round and the summer months are especially brutal. This product has made it so much more bearable as my room is always nice and cool when I enter it. I'd say my room is a good 160-180 sqft and it cools the whole thing just fine (I went ahead and got the 10k model instead of the 8k because it was only a few dollars more at the time).I've only had it for a few weeks now but I can say I actually feel comfortable in my room again. I love the cold so I usually keep it on a 69 when I'm in and sleeping and then when I'm working I turn on the sleep function at a 75 so it cycles on and off to atleast keep it cool when I'm not in it.As for the noise, as others have said, it's not bad at all. I have 2 bends in my window tube and it's barely noticeable once you get used to it. As others have described, it's like a hotel a/c. And maybe the same amount of sound as a fan on max settings.Installation was much easier than I thought it'd be because I thought the window kit would be much more complicated but it turns out it wasn't. I have a regular window so it slides to adjust perfectly. I was able to seal it up pretty well nothing gets in or out.I have not gotten my first electricity bill but will update when I do to see how much it has changed it.

136,B01DLPUWGW,,"August 22, 2020",Verified Purchase,Nice AC Unit and No Complaints,"  Normally the San Francisco East Bay does not get super hot summers being in the upper 70s and lower 80s, so most homes do not have AC. A recent extended heat wave put day temps to the high 90s and over 100, with high 80s over night, so I decided to get this unit for the master bedroom. It arrived two days after ordering and reading cautionary review here, I let it sit for 24 hours - which is also now recommended on the both the box and supplementary instruction sheet inside the shipping box - to let the refrigerant resettle. Installation was easy, although as the manual for the unit advises some improvising was in order. Instead of using the foam strips that came with the unit, I bought a couple rolls of self-adhesive Sponge Window Seal tape from HomeDepot; 3/4"" and 1-1/4"" wide rolls. My widow is a slider and has a vertical opening 56"" which is more than the self-adhesive foam supplied with the unit. The sponge seal tape was also much thicker (3/8"") than the unit foam. I followed the instructions using my seal tapes and made nice seals. The three piece Winder Slider was at max extension, so in addition the the screws I used some white duct tape to reenforce the it. I also ran the white duct tape over the form so that it closed the seams and hide the black sponge form seal strips. I they bought some white thin foam poster from the local craft store to cover over the window opening opposite the ac exhaust port/slider and block outside light. Lastly I did use the non-adhesive foam strip to seal the vertical gap between the window frame and outer window - just sort of pushed it into the gap. Like any ac unit it is going to make noise and you will know its on. I took some sound level readings. At 2 feet; with the unit off the ambient room level was 33 dB and with it running set to 72 degrees it was 58 dB.Until I read the user guide I really didn't know that this was a semi-permanent installation in the window, which it is. It can be moved at the end of the summer heat season, but you'll have to go though the whole foam seal and tape routine to reinstall it. if you want to leave the window slider kit and seals in place you'll have to deal with the hose attachment hole as it doesn't come with a cap or plug for the opening of the window slider kit. If I decide to disconnect the unit and put in storage closet, I will probably make a cover/cap out of the foam board and tape over the hole - but it would be nice it it just came with a cap for the hole.

The LG unit was slightly larger (14K BTU), and it was significantly more expensive than this model. This model is good for the price...AND if you are using it for the right application. My bedroom is only about 14x14. Great for a small to medium space. Noise level is “fine.”  It’s like white noise. The normal for a portable unit.Installation was easy. The only thing keeping this from 5 stars was the single small plastic “screw” that was to be used to secure the sliding window baffles. It simply did not work to secure the sliding parts. I had to use regular metal screws from my tool box. Not a huge deal, but poorly designed for that and would be an easy fix.Currently chilling at 70 degrees.

184,B01DLPUWGW,,"August 4, 2020",Verified Purchase,The Best There Is,"  After buying one of these 12,000 BTU units, I was so impressed with its performance I tried to buy another one, but only 10,000 BTU, but I was unable to find one anywhere that could be shipped out before September (this was in June 2020). So I ended up finding a 10,000 BTU TOSHIBA Portable at Home Depot figuring Toshiba had to be at least as good as Black and Decker, if not better. Wrong, the Black and Decker blows it away in performance and it's not just the extra 2,000 BTU's because I have the Toshiba in a room 1/3 of the size, only a 10' x 10' room so 10,000 BTU's should be vast overkill, but it's not, at all. I gave the Black and Decker only 4 stars for noise level because it IS pretty noisy, but ALL portable units are and this one is no more and no less. Likewise I gave it only 4 stars for energy efficiency because I don't know yet, I haven't gotten the electric bill yet. The 4 stars for warmth are because if you run the exhaust hose out too far it will throw quite a bit of heat, which is a testament to it's efficiency: an A/C unit is essentially a heat pump; it doesn't put cold air in, it takes hot air out...as exhaust. It doesn't matter to me because I just pushed the unit up against the wall where I wanted to use it, marked the outlet there, and cut a 6"" hole right through the wall ducting it to the outside directly using only 6"" of fully collapsed exhaust hose so there is no detectable heat transfer at all.

218,B01DLPUWGW,,"July 15, 2020",Verified Purchase,Probably the best bang for buck out there,"  This seemed to be the best unit for the price available. Much more quiet than a window mount unit but still not silent as no AC unit is. I can run it in dry Southern California all day and night and it continues to put out cold air. If the cold air starts to diminish you can help by insulating and shortening the duct run out the window or making sure it is drained (never and issue for me with dry climate)The things I don't like are the remote functions. There is no back-light on the remote LCD so a challenge to see at night and the buttons are complicated to set on/off timers not responding properly. This is a RF remote not an IR remote so it sends more complicated info. I would prefer it to be simple and work every time. The only buttons on the unit itself are on/off, temperature, mode, and fan speed. So you need the remote for all other functions.The other thing that is annoying is the lights on the unit are super bright and will light up your room at night. A simple dimming sheet fixes this.Lastly, when the unit does get the room down to temperature it will cycle on and off every few minutes. Unfortunately no one makes a variable speed AC unit with better modulating settings so I can't hold it against this unit.Note: The first unit I received was definitely used and was missing parts, seems to happen a lot on Amazon these days, but a new unit was promptly shipped and the old one picked up by UPS for no extra charge.",Anthony,4.0,"Probably the best bang for buck out there  This seemed to be the best unit for the price available.

299,B08DTPRNPK,Color: Black,"August 9, 2020",Verified Purchase,💝💘❄️❄️❄️ Negative Ion Generator Really Cools the Air ❄️❄️❄️💓💓,"   As I'm writing this review on this Mikikin Portable Air conditioner Fan, the mercury outside my apartment is in the 90+. If I had left my vegetables outside on kitchen countertops, they turned yellow or brown quickly because the indoor temperatures are so high lately. I do have an AC in the apartment, but I'm reluctant to use unless it's necessary, when pets or elderly are at home. Once I turn that baby up, there's no way I'm turning it down, and my electric bills skyrockets.Most of the time, I live alone, so in order to cut down on electricity bills and still stay cool, that's when this Mikikin Portable Air Conditioner Fan address two of my concerns amazingly, and here's why:PROS==== * Effective: this tiny box actually provides really cool air to your own personal space, I slept well last night without having to keep energy hogging AC on all night * 💘💝❄️❄️The Technology ❄️❄️:💓💕 while being so tiny yet able to provide cool air is this unit contains a ""Negative Ion Generator"" which generates negative ions to break up the water molecules, allowing to dry your hair faster in Negative Ion Hair Dryer. Similarly, the negative ions break up the water molecules (in the reservoir) & help it cool down much faster 💕💓❄️❄️❄️❄️💝💓  * Two Modes 「Water」&「Ice Cubes」: you can fill the water reservoir with either water, I only use this & it cools down amazingly fast; if you got ice cubes at home, you can fill the reservoir with ice cubes, the negative ions do even a better job, water in ANY state, liquid (water) or Solid (ice) is H2O, so the negative ions work exactly the same way, only with ice, you get obviously much cooler air!!!!  * Features & Functionalities:  - 3 fan speeds (press POWER to toggle through different fan power settings)  - serves as LED night light by long press the MODE button to turn ON/OFF  - Rechargeable via micro-USB cable so you can take this baby anywhere & not tied to a cord & having to be plugged into a wall outlet  - at merely 22OZ, that's portable anywhere - office, car, beaches🆗🆙👍NOTE👍🆗🆙Some reviews negatively reflected this fam, and didn't do justice, again, with reasonable expectation, it's < $30, C'mon NOW😙😏😏  Noise Level: some complained too loud, I had it at highest level #3, and I leave it right next to my pillow as I sleep, I sleep right through every night - so loud noise isn't justified  Not Cool Enough: again, as ""Beauty is in the eye of the beholder"", noise Level & cold are, too! I find it reasonably cold enough so that it won't run up my electricity bill, you can't have it both ways!The VERDICT==========  If you don't have or want to keep your electricity bills down especially during the summer, and still want to stay cool, then there's nothing better than this Mikikin portable air conditioner fan. It uses naked iron technology to break down the water molecules so the air with cool faster, you have two options to fill the reservoir with ice or water either way it works equally well! Of course iceccubes allowed the temperature to be lowe to begin with, so you can extra cool air out of the fan. It weighs a little more than a pound so it's extremely lightweight and it's so small  you can take this baby anywhere because it's rechargeable!. But most of all, not only it keeps you cool but he saves you electricity bills!!!!👍👍😂😂😂💓💘💝 HIGHLY RECOMMENDED💕💕💕💕  -",GLDNK9US,5.0,"💝💘❄️❄️❄️ Negative Ion Generator Really Cools the Air ❄️❄️❄️💓💓   As I'm writing this review on this Mikikin Portable Air conditioner Fan, the mercury outside my apartment is in the 90+. If I had left my vegetables outside on kitchen countertops, they turned yellow or brown quickly because the indoor temperatures are so high lately. I do have an AC in the apartment, but I'm reluctant to use unless it's necessary, when pets or elderly are at home. Once I turn that baby up, there's no way I'm turning it down, and my electric bills skyrockets.Most of the time, I live alone, so in order to cut down on electricity bills and still stay cool, that's when this Mikikin Portable Air Conditioner Fan address two of my concerns amazingly, and here's why:PROS==== * Effective: this tiny box actually provides really cool air to your own personal space, I slept well last night without having to keep energy hogging AC on all night * 💘💝❄️❄️The Technology ❄️❄️:💓💕 while being so tiny yet able to provide cool air is this unit contains a ""Negative Ion Generator"" which generates negative ions to break up the water molecules, allowing to dry your hair faster in Negative Ion Hair Dryer. Similarly, the negative ions break up the water molecules (in the reservoir) & help it cool down much faster 💕💓❄️❄️❄️❄️💝💓  * Two Modes 「Water」&「Ice Cubes」: you can fill the water reservoir with either water, I only use this & it cools down amazingly fast; if you got ice cubes at home, you can fill the reservoir with ice cubes, the negative ions do even a better job, water in ANY state, liquid (water) or Solid (ice) is H2O, so the negative ions work exactly the same way, only with ice, you get obviously much cooler air!!!!  * Features & Functionalities:  - 3 fan speeds (press POWER to toggle through different fan power settings)  - serves as LED night light by long press the MODE button to turn ON/OFF  - Rechargeable via micro-USB cable so you can take this baby anywhere & not tied to a cord & having to be plugged into a wall outlet  - at merely 22OZ, that's portable anywhere - office, car, beaches🆗🆙👍NOTE👍🆗🆙Some reviews negatively reflected this fam, and didn't do justice, again, with reasonable expectation, it's < $30, C'mon NOW😙😏😏  Noise Level: some complained too loud, I had it at highest level #3, and I leave it right next to my pillow as I sleep, I sleep right through every night - so loud noise isn't justified  Not Cool Enough: again, as ""Beauty is in the eye of the beholder"", noise Level & cold are, too! I find it reasonably cold enough so that it won't run up my electricity bill, you can't have it both ways!The VERDICT==========  If you don't have or want to keep your electricity bills down especially during the summer, and still want to stay cool, then there's nothing better than this Mikikin portable air conditioner fan. It uses naked iron technology to break down the water molecules so the air with cool faster, you have two options to fill the reservoir with ice or water either way it works equally well! Of course iceccubes allowed the temperature to be lowe to begin with, so you can extra cool air out of the fan. It weighs a little more than a pound so it's extremely lightweight and it's so small  you can take this baby anywhere because it's rechargeable!.

305,B08DTPRNPK,Color: Black,"August 5, 2020",Verified Purchase,Portable cooling solution this summer,"  It’s summer, and I got this portable AC to help make things a little more comfortable.  I bought this for my teenage son’s desk so that we don’t have to use the house AC often.  It did helped a lot to make the air more cool.The package was smaller than I expected.  The box is thin with minimal branding.  Inside the box is the portable AC, a plastic squeeze bottle, and a mini USB cable.  I like the matte finish as it is not a fingerprint magnet.  The build quality is ok, sturdy enough to withstand a few bumps. It’s very small and cute, I was skeptical at first if it has enough power to really cool a small space.  It has no power adapter, but you can connect this to any USB port to power it up and charge the batteries.  The batteries are good to have for total portability, but we’re using this mostly plugged on top of a desk.  There are only 2 buttons for operations, it was a little confusing at first, but after reading the user manual, it is simple to operate.  I was surprised how powerful this small fan is, it blows a lot of air for its size.  The product has a small access door on the side to fill in the water compartment, but you can also slide out the entire back cover to separate the water compartment for refills.  I prefer to do the later for easier and faster refills.  It does blow a cool breeze when filled with water.  On a hot day, it is very helpful to cool a small space like a workstation or desk space.  My son also uses this while he sleeps beside his nightstand.  Not the coolest, but you can definitely feel a big difference in comfort.Overall, it’s a great little product.  Don’t expect this to cool an entire room, it’s meant to be used for small personal spaces.  It doesn’t blow cold air, but a cool breeze enough to make you comfortable during hot days.

I ran this in a room that is approximately 13 x 16 with 12-foot ceilings (208 square feet or 2496 cubic feet). The higher ceilings mean this room has a lot more air to cool that you’d think by the 208 square foot floor area, but the Midea AC dropped it 4 degrees in 30 minutes on a very hot day.This A/C has some really thoughtful design touches, it’s easy to roll, a dream to set up, the plastic accessories are VERY heavy duty, and it works really, really well. Did I mention it was easy to set up and cooled an incredible amount? At 42 degrees, the air coming out of this baby is 2-4 degrees colder than my 5-ton Goodman A/C unit is putting out.What’s not to love? Well, the instruction booklet could use a re-write. Some parts of it – especially those regarding draining – are very confusing and pictures are misleading. So it took some extra work to puzzle things out. It also talks about the heater and heat pump, even though there is no heater in this unit. Confusing. The instruction book and the drainage system both need work.Note: You cannot run a drain tube up and out the window as is shown in the pictures from this A/C; it just won’t work. By the way, this A/C has two drain tubes: one at the bottom of the back and one mid-center of the back. Frankly, this A/C unit needs a good removable drain tray as part of its design. You definitely want a tray or low tub for this to drain into. We live in a semi-arid region and this still pulled water out of the air.  In addition, to drain this when you’re getting ready to put it away, you really need to lay it flat on its back, which you need to do very gently, so you don’t break said drain off. I laid it – very gently – on a layer of towels to do this. Plus, you’re supposed to run this fan-only for 12 hours to completely dry it out before storing to prevent mildew and mold. I’m running it 24 hours, even at our low humidity, because I do NOT want this to mold.The unit can use the remote for sensing temperature and using that to base its operation off of, rather than taking the temp at the unit itself. Very nice touch! I did not use the smart app because we’re using this as a temporary A/C. If we were using it permanently in one room, we would use the app. But with the remote and using it temporarily in one room, the app didn’t add enough that we felt it was useful.Overall, I’m incredibly pleased with how well this unit works, although I really wish the drainage system was designed with a built-in removable tray. Two drains to work with totally outside the unit is a bit inconvenient. However, even with that inconvenience, I really like this thing.As the parent of kiddos with autism, there are causes near and dear to my heart. Let Amazon donate to your favorite charity!

The setup was fairly easy with help from the manual. Getting the wifi setup also was pretty easy thanks to the included QR code.It can be alittle noisey when it's first starting up the compressor.

320,B087CQVC9G,Size: for Rooms up to 330 sq ft (Alexa Enabled),"August 22, 2020",Verified Purchase,"Very happy, recommend, & only a couple minor cons","  First, this thing cranks out cool air. We bought it as a replacement for a slightly weaker off brand unit. It is also a lot quieter than our previous standing AC, which was a nice surprise. It is about the same noise as a fan on high with the underlying base from the AC unit on.Be sure to cover or wrap the exhaust tubing with reflective material. This helps tremendously on any standing AC unit. So many negative reviews because people don't know to wrap or cover the tubing to keep the heat flowing outside.It's fairly easy to roll around. The cord is a decent length and the plastic window insert to hold the exhaust tube is very adjustable for even a larger width or height depending on your windows. Our windows are side sliders & it's 57"" from top to bottom of our slider. We could adjust the slider to fill the whole gap!The remote is pretty basic. The LED screen stays on constantly so I worry it may run thru batteries. It has a temp sensor so the AC doesn't think the room is cool and turn off too quickly. The app is very handy once you get it setup. Better than that remote IMO.Cons: (I break them out but they really are minor compare to how well it works.)The app setup is confusing and the type of device options arent accurate. We have a standing unit but had to go under ""window unit"" to get the proper setup instructions. TIP: When using the app to sett up the WiFi connection on the unit, TEMPORARILY TURN OFF YOUR CELLPHONE'S LTE DATA CONNECTION. This caused the WiFi syncing to constantly fail. Once past that, setup is super easy. It's Alexa and Google speaker ready and the Google version works really well.The ambient temperature in the room doesn't display anywhere on the unit or the remote. It ONLY displays in the app, once the device is setup. This is minor but annoying as hell. The digital readout on the device is also very hard to see. The plastic cover makes it very dim. In bright light you simply cannot read it. However, it's very easy to read on the remote.The window slider doesn't come with enough plastic bolts to hold it together. This was a head scratcher for sure. You get 3, not 4 or 6, but 3.  We used our own screws so it's workable, but if you need to stand it up in a side sliding window like ours, prepare to be annoyed a wee bit. LololCaveat: we do not plan to use the dry/dehumidifier option so have zero feedback on that aspect.

It took about 30 minutes to cool the space from 85 degrees down to 70. When the compressor turns on it is a bit loud, but didn’t wake me up or keep me awake at night. It is a portable AC unit so I didn’t expect it to be as quiet as central air. Once it reaches the desired temperate the fan continues to run keeping the room cool. The fan is relatively quiet and the compressor doesn’t turn on all that often. The LED screen is easy to read, but not so bright it lights up the room at night. There is also an option to turn off the LED lights.Installation is very easy with no tools required. Removable filters are a great feature and are very easy to clean. Having filters around the condensing coils is a big plus, as it will reduce maintenance and extend the life of the unit. I live in a dry climate and after running the unit for 5 days I haven’t had to drain the water. Unit moves easily from one room to another.Setting the louvers on the front to swing mode allows the airflow to rotate. This is a nice change from other units I’ve had that only blow air in one direction. The airflow with just the fan running is strong enough to gently move a ceiling fan.The remote is easy to use and can control nearly all features. The remote is especially useful when I’m in bed and want to adjust the temperature.  This is a “smart” unit that can be controlled via WiFi with Alexa or the Midea app. Reviews on the Midea app are not great so I didn’t bother setting it up.

Not quiet.","  Summary: This powerful air conditioner is keeping my 400 sf non-insulated garage cool during a heat wave! The remote and app make it easy to use. It is sturdily made, the wheels are convenient, and it looks nice. However, the exhaust system can only fit a sliding window, using a non-insulated window-panel with no outside extension. The filter is just a screen. It is inconvenient to drain. And it is as loud as a window air conditioner.My experience: Once I wrestled this 70 pound air conditioning unit into my garage, it was easy to maneuver on strong small wheels with a low center of gravity so it does not tip over too easily. I plugged it into a normal household outlet, and it ran fine. The unit has a nice modern look, and it feels sturdy and non-breakable. The app was as easy to install, but my wifi is weak in my garage, so I am using the physical remote, which works fine. It is doing a great job, and even though I have the 12000 BTU model, it is doing fine keeping my non-insulated 400 square foot garage at a comfortable temperature during outside temperatures over 90 F this week.Why only 4 stars? I would give it 5 stars for it’s power alone, and it has features that I appreciate. But I find two issues that bother me. The hot air exhaust is a typical round hose with a rectangular non-insulated window-frame panel and no external extension of the hose. So it only fits one type of window. On a hot day, a lot of heat is coming through that panel, especially because the hot exhaust air cannot be diverted farther from the window. Also, the filter is really just a screen, which does very little for air quality. It will take large particles and fibers out of the air, but it does nothing about allergens or odors, and it misses a lot of dust.Other suggestions for improvements: Larger wheels would make it easier to move this 70 lb unit on uneven surfaces. Drainage could be made more convenient. Provide a bluetooth option, or improve the sensitivity of the wifi receiver so the app can be used with weak wifi. Finally, i have had quiet window units, and i dont know how they do it, but this would be much nicer if it were quieter.Dont get me wrong.

It is barely a whisper and I am most appreciative to that fact because the last one we had 3 months ago was annoyingly loud and it was a MAJOR name brand.  This little baby just purrs and it puts out cold air so just saying that is a solid 5 star rating for me.Although I am already satisfied enough to give it 5 stars, there are other features that would make it a 5+++ rating.

Some states are even offering rebates for Midea's AC's. This is a smart ac however, that's the one feature we don't use. We control ours manually and it works just fine. I couldn't ask for more with this product. I love it and I love what it does for me!

On the high side, it effectively cools up to a 350 square foot room and is easy to operate.  On the downside, it is a very heavy unit, is loud, and Wi-Fi was difficult to set up.WHAT'S IN THE BOXThe unit comes with a hose adapter, window slider adapter, exhaust hose, window slider, various foam seals, short drain hose and drain hose adapter, a remote control, and a user's manual.THE AIR CONDITIONERThis is a very nice looking air conditioner.  It is 29 inches high, 17 inches wide, and 13"" in depth at its thickest point.  I did not weigh the air conditioner, but it is quite heavy.  It is rated at nearly 68 pounds by Amazon, but I think some of the shipping weight was due to the packaging and accessories.  Still, it probably weighs in in the 60-65 pound range so it is a bit of a bear to carry around.  It does have two handles on the sides, but given the bulk it is still difficult to carry.  That said, it is lighter than my older Penguino unit and, unlike the Penguino, it rolls freely on it's integrated wheels.  So once you get it on the right level of your house, it's easy to move from room to room, eon hard wood or on low pile carpet.Atop, there is a control panel that utilizes green LEDs, buttons for each display.  There is an LED number display for the temperature setting.  The controls are well layed out, easy to use, and make a lot of sense.The back of the unit has the exhaust hose port and the port for water drainage (which is covered).  The front has the vents (louvers) to direct the cool air.  These can be positioned as just open or can swing up and down.  (There is no way to direct air side to side.)The remote control (batteries included!), is an old-style remote with an LCD temperature display, and also is well layed out and easy to use.SET UPBasically, you attach the connectors to the hose.  Fit the slider in the window of your choice.  Attache the hose to the exhaust port and the other end into the window slider port.  Both hose ports ports have secure connections.  On my much older Penguino brand, the hose connections were a major problem. The either the connector would disengage from the window or the unit or the hose would flip out out the connector.  The Midea system is much, much better in this respect.PLEASE NOTE: given that the hose exits from the back and needs to curl around to attach to the window, the unit cannot fit flush with the wall.  The unit ends up sitting ~ 1 foot from the wall due to hose related issues and the unit is already 13"" deep.  If you orient it face forward, it will stick out about 25"" from the wall, so you need to account for this.  If you decide to have it face sideways (may make it a little more difficult to access the controls), it would still stick out at least 17"", as it is 17"" wide.  At some point, it would be great if manufacturers of these units would have the exhaust ports on the side, so the unit could sit flush with the wall.  (To avoid the need for left handed or right handed unit, they could make an exhaust port on the side with a lever to direct the air on one side or the other.)Unlike a standard window unit, setting this up in a window is a breeze.  You do not have  to position a very heavy air conditioning unit or secure the window.  The slider simply sits on the sill and you expand it.  You can still move the window up and down.  If you are connecting the air conditioner on a ground floor, you may need to secure the window so that no one will break in, but there is no need to secure the window so that your air conditioner will not fall to the ground. By the same token, it's easy to roll the air conditioner to another location and set it up in a different window.If you decide to use this as a dehumidifier only, you will need to buy a longer drain hose.  The hose that is supplied is only two feet long. This is way too short for any set up I could think of.COOLING/USEI was really impressed at how well it cools.  The device is rated at 14,000 BTU (ASHRE) or 8200 BTU (SACC standard). I would say, as a rule of thumb, that these free standing devices never quite cool as well per BTU as their in-the-window relatives.  My older free standing device is rated at 12,000 BTU, however, and this unit knocks the pants off of it.  It seems to cool our room with the same efficacy as a window unit rated at ~8000 BTU if this helps.Settings include:1) Mode: Auto, cool, dry (dehumidify only), fan2) Fan: Auto, high, mid, low (the fan will usually just kick in when needed; you can opt to keep it on constantly by pressing the fan button for three seconds)3) Temperature Setting: you can set the goal temperature for coling modes4) Swing: control the vent louvers to either stay stationary and push air forward or to swing up and down (there is no right to left swing option)Wireless: this activates the Wi-Fi and is needed for set up only5) Sleep Mode: this will lower the air conditioning overnight for a period; the curve is preset.  You can adjust it but only using the app.6) Timer: you can set the timer by pressing the timer button and selecting the time to shut off using the temperature control LEDs7) Additionally, you can set the LED lights as always on or off using either the handheld remote or the app (there is no LED control on the unit's control panel)8) You can set schedules using the app, but not on the unit itselfAll features work as you would expect them to.  There is no 'Eco' setting per se, but the Auto setting works well to keep the room cool and turn off the air conditioner when it is not needed.  As above, at default the fan will shut off when not needed; if you prefer to have it on constantly you can press the fan button for three seconds.  There is an indicator light to show that the fan is on constant mode.The controls on the control panel are set up logically and--at least for a modern, Wi-Fi capable device seem a little retro/90s, but they absolutely work and it is very easy to see the settings and what you are doing.Cooling is excellent and the auto mode functions as is expected. I have set the device up for use as an air conditioner (not as a dehumidifier) so I have not connected the drain hose.  The unit still works well in dry (dehumidify) mode and I have had no problems or errors.  I'm assuming that the moisture is vented through the exhaust port but if you are only using it as a dehumidifier, your exhaust port would not be connected to a window and you'd need a drain connected.  Well, at any rate, no errors or problems in any mode...NOISE:When the compressor kicks in fully, the air conditioner puts out 65-70 dB of noise.  Realize that 70 dB is actually twice the loudness of 60 dB.  So you go from the equivalent of 'conversation in a restaurant' to 'vacuum cleaner' when the compressor really kicks in.  At baseline, the thing is down around 50 dB which is tolerable.The problem, of course, is when you are sleeping at night.  The thing is humming, pleasantly, around 50 dB and you are sleeping.  At some point, the compressor kicks in at 65-70 dB and the change is loud enough to wake you up.  Remember, as well, that dB levels do not account for the quality of the sound.  The compressor kick in is a two parter, with a higher pitch whine followed by a mechanical thud and low pitch hum when it goes into full gear.I can sleep through anything, but not so much my wife.  We've decided that in a very hot summer, it is still easier to sleep with the noise than the humidity and the heat, but before buying this unit, you should take this into consideration.WONKY WI-FI SET UP/2.4 GHZ vs. 5 GHZ WI-FI ISSUESWi-Fi set up was a challenge for me.  It took me quite some time to figure out the problem, but the major issue is that you can ONLY set up the Wi-Fi app on a 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi signal.  The more modern 5 GHz Wi-Fi will NOT work for set up. (Although, once everything was set up, the app worked on all devices.)The quick solution--set it up on an Android phone after you go into settings and restrict the signal to 2.4 GHz Wi-Fi only.In all fairness, the app warns you, but: 1) it really didn't register for me that this would be a problem, as both my iPhone and router work on both frequencies (you'd think the app would self adjust); 2) the app goes through all the steps (and man, does that take time) and then only tanks at the end when you reach 99% set up; 3) the app does not self adjust the frequency on your phone AND does not tell you how or point you in the direction of how to solve the problem.I really had a hard time with this.  For one, I have a modern router that works on both 2.4 and 5 GHz frequencies, but--wouldn't cha know--I could not figure out how to get either my iPhone or router to only play in the 2.4 GHz frequency range while I was setting up. And, yes.  I tried.Although my computer detects two networks from my router, one for each band, my iPhone only shows one network.  In an effort to 'keep things simple,' there is apparently no setting to restrict to 2.4 GHz only.  Ditto for my Netgear MR60 router--there are a gazillion settings for just about everything but none to cut off the 5 GHz signal and work on 2.4 GHz alone.  Why?  I don't know.  Why would the app not adjust the Wi-Fi to work with the proper signal?  I don't know.  Why would the app connect to a 5 GHz signal and not error before it 'tried' to connect.  I don't know.  Given that 5 GHz is the modern standard, they should upgrade their hardware or at least get the software to settle conflicts automatically.Before giving up, I used my wife's Android phone to try to set up.  At first, it also didn't work.  Then I went into settings and, lo and behold, the folks at Android give you the option to only work at 2.4 GHz.  The app still took a long time to set up the Wi-Fi, but it worked.It would have been even better if the company provided a web portal to set up the Wi-Fi.  This would make it a lot easier to get set up.  For whatever reason, tech companies seem to think that phone apps are more 'hip' and 'now.'  That said, there are still some things that might be easier on a computer...APP OPTIONS:The app is a nice touch, but it's function is limited.  You can turn the device on and off remotely, so if you are coming home you can restart your AC from your car so that when you arrive the house is cool.  You can set mode (Auto, Cool, Dry, etc.), fan speed, the flap movement, and turn on and off the LED lights.You can set an on-off schedule that is different for each day. The system is a little convoluted but once you get the hang of it it is doable.  You can also set the 'sleep curve' to adjust the temperature overnight, after you fall asleep.  This is a little more intuitive, but will not vary from day to day.Again, a web-based interface on a laptop would likely be easier to use than a phone app.Interestingly, Midea appears to make the Toshiba line of Wi-Fi air conditioners.  So if you own both Midea and Toshiba Wi-Fi air conditioners, you can use either the Midea or Toshiba app to connect all of your air conditioners within the same app.ALEXA:Once I set up the Wi-Fi, setting up Alexa was really not a big deal.  The problem with Alexa, for me, was getting Alexa to respond correctly.  First, you have a limited series of commands.  You can turn the unit on, turn it off, and change the temperature.  That's pretty much it.As with many things Alexa, you have to phrase it correctly (e.g. 'Alexa ask my dear air to turn on air conditioner').  Alexa seems to have problems with 'Midea air' (e.g. 'my dear air').  As above, Midea also makes Toshiba's line of air conditioners.  I switched to the Toshiba app because Alexa seems to have fewer problems with the word Toshiba, s o you get a more consistent response to the 'Alexa, ask Toshiba to turn on air conditioner' command. Moreover, with the Toshiba app, you can just say, 'Alexa, turn on Master Bedroom,' and Alexa knows what that means.CONCLUSION:This unit has its ups and downs but actually functions really well as an air conditioner.  Highs include the cooling capacity and the variety of functions.  Lows include noise levels and an app that could use an upgrade (and could be easier to install).  The device is heavy as well, but this is par for the course with this kind of air conditioner.  If I could change one thing about this unit, I would want them to find a way to cut back on the noise.All-in-all, I am satisfied with this device. It performs as well or better than similar, free standing, portable air conditioners and has advanced features.",Jojoleb,4.0,"Excellent cooling capacity, but loud, heavy, and app was difficult to set up  PROS:Effective coolingEasy physical set upSimple to useEasy to use control panelServiceable remoteHose connects firmly and does not disconnectWi-Fi AppAlexa compatibility (with some limitations)CONS:Loud when compressor is activeHeavyVery short drainage hose supplied for dehumidify modeWonky Wi-Fi set up--app set up can only be done with 2.4 GHz Wi-FiLimited control/immature appNo laptop or online interface--app control onlyNeeds to be about a foot away from the wallLouvers swing up and down; no way to direct cool air side to sideOVERVIEWThe Midea portable air conditioner is an effective portable air conditioner.

The app is a bit annoying, having you sign in every time you open it, but everything works nicely for the most part.The big problem with this AC and all the others like this, is that it is sucking in room temperature air, blowing it outside, and forcing the hot outside air right back into the room to make up for the difference.

This means that if you use this in one room of your house, it will make the rest of your house warmer as it sucks in air from outside. I have no idea why so many air conditioners go for this design when a second hose would fix the issue completely. I feel like it deserves low stars because of this alone, but luckily for this unit, it does everything else well.The unit is about as quiet as you could expect it to be, with the sound of the blowing air being almost as loud as the compressor itself.

374,B087CQVC9G,Size: for Rooms up to 330 sq ft (Alexa Enabled),"August 3, 2020",Not Verified,Works as expected...consult the manual for expectation management,"  I fully believe that many of the complaints in reviews for this product may be people's lack of reading or understanding the directions.  And perhaps the fact that having multiple sizes of products with different sizes also touting different features may have also confused a lot of the buyers.  It also appears that these problems dog other manufacturers of portable AC units from looking at some other product reviews.  Note that this review is for the largest model in the lineup, which as far as I can tell sports all the available features.First, just know this:  for cooling mode, you can set the fan to low, med, or high, and you can also keep it on constantly so that it doesn't go off and on with the compressor.  And mine was surprisingly quiet even on high - much, much better than AC units at low to mid range hotels.  And it is a very steady noise, no rattling or anything like that, so it probably measures much lower in sones than it does in decibels.  And being able to put it on constant is very important (that feature is not available for all modes, but it is for cooling).Also, on AC mode, you do NOT need a condensate line.  These things somehow use an evaporative technique presumably similar to refrigerators.  And it seems to still remove some humidity from the space, probably just by blowing it out with the hot air.  I know a bit about refrigeration, but I can't say for sure how exactly that is supposed to work.  They do tell you that extra condensate will temporarily accumulate in the bottom of the unit, and in rare, severe cases, you may have to drain it (I don't see that happening often, but I will admit it would be a major pain for most people given the weight of this thing...and since many people would use it in the bedroom, where would you drain it).If you use it in ""dry""/dehumidification mode, you'll have to hook up a continuous drain, and you'd likely want it in your basement.  If you want that, but a dehumidifier for $100 instead.  It's nice that this is multi-purpose, but normally you'd want both at the same time...not like you need dehumidification in the winter most places.Heat pump mode also needs a drain line, so that could get more complicated.You must vent outside for AC, but NOT for dehumidify.  Tube is too large to go out a 4"" dryer vent, but I understand on some smaller models, you could do that.Overall, I am very pleased with this unit.  I put in a whole-house unit a while back, but I need an AC in my attic when I want to do work in there in the summer months (and I recently changed out a window, which has too small of an opening for the old window unit I kept around).  This thing functions for me exactly how I expected, and I also like having it around as a backup or even as extra cooling for sleeping should I ever decide I need it (because my upstairs is still warmer than downstairs since I designed the HVAC for a heating-dominant geographic location).I was particularly pleased with the installation package.  The window plates are thick and rest inside the frame perfectly.  The foam pieces are great if you are going to keep it in one place all summer long.  The duct shrinks down to about 1 foot long.  They also give you a small bracket to ""lock"" the window, although I've noticed this won't work on my ""double-hung"" attic windows (so you may need a contingency plan if your frames already have something on the sides of the top frame...read the manual and figure it out before you buy if you're concerned about this...it's only two screws anyway, but most windows have pretty cheap locks anyway, so not much difference if you can use the locking kit).I've always hated window units more than anything, since they're so wasteful, ugly, and let so much sound from outside into the interior.  I believe this would do just as good of a job as the giant window unit I used to use downstairs, but it would be so much better in so many ways.  And I could even face it inside better than I could before (used a side window because it's just too ugly to put it out the front).  But of course now it takes up some room inside, which is the only drawback.  And it costs more than window units, I think.  But you can move it around as necessary (although I'll tell you dragging it upstairs to downstairs all the time would get quite old).I personally don't use ""smart"" stuff, but it does appear that the app offers a lot of features, and I think only by getting your unit from a big company specializing in AC like Midea can you get such a robust app for an appliance like this.Overall, I'm very impressed.  I think if you can find a good place to put this, and take the time to install it well, you can have a much nicer experience with this than you would with a window unit.  It's more expensive, but much less so than a mini-split or adding a whole-house system.",MussSyke,5.0,"Works as expected...consult the manual for expectation management  I fully believe that many of the complaints in reviews for this product may be people's lack of reading or understanding the directions.

Good for smaller, enclosed rooms.","  This MIDEA MAP14S1CWT 3-in-1 Portable Air Conditioner works about as well as most other portable ACs - and if you never owned one before, you'll need to do your research before purchasing them, because they will NOT be as powerful as a window unit (or obviously, central AC), despite claiming to cool the same square footage as one. I personally think everyone should have one of these in their homes, however, even if they have central AC - just as a backup, in case your central AC konks out for any reason in the dead of summer - which is exactly what happened to me.Like most other portable ACs, this claims to cool up to 330 sq ft. Note the ""up to"" part. That is a best case scenario, and the reality is that it will most likely not cover anywhere near that amount - at least, not consistently. The closer you are to the unit, the cooler - and there's a small radius around it that stays that way. Unlike a window unit, which has more blowing power and can pull out the humidity/heat faster (and drain out the moisture far more quickly outside), these are weaker, slower, and cannot handle open spaces very well - especially if you have higher ceilings and your floorplan flows into more square footage. They work well, however, in smaller and fully enclosed rooms - or for people who might have a slightly warmer room in one area of their house and they want some extra cooling on top of what they already have in their central AC. These are nice for bedrooms, small studies, and other rooms where you can close the door, etc. - and they're obviously easier to move around and way more subtle than bulky window units sticking out your window outside. They CAN get a space cool, but it needs to be enclosed in a restricted space in order for them to be effective. They're perfect for temporary situations or as a backup to an already working AC. Outside of that, you're going to be really disappointed with any and all portable ones like this one. I don't feel that it's fair to knock off a bunch of stars for it not doing what it wasn't really designed to do in the first place - but just note that these are limited in what they can do. You're paying for the ease and luxury of portability with these if you are trying to figure out whether to get a window unit or a portable one.This one is no exception to that, but it's certainly better than nothing when you're in a pinch and need AC in a limited space, especially if you're not allowed to have a window unit (or don't want to mess with the hassle of one). If you place this in a smaller room with the door closed and blowing reasonably near your bed, for instance, it will get quite cold. I stuck this in a kids' bedroom so they could be comfortable at night while we were waiting to replace a broken compressor on our central AC unit. It works as well as another name brand we purchased from a brick and mortar store that we placed in another room - but this one was significantly more expensive for doing the same thing the other does, which is why I knocked off a star.Installation is fairly straightforward (just read the instructions and make sure your window can accommodate it), and the wheels roll nicely when you are needing to move it to another location (or for storage). You will need to make sure your window is sealed pretty tightly for best results. The noise level (all portable ones I've tried are very noisy) is the same as other brands we've used - such as Hisense, LG, etc. Yep, it's noisy.The remote is simple to use, and it is pretty comparable in every other way to other brands. I prefer the location of the fins on this one over some other ones, but that's just me - and it seems to dehumidify pretty well on the whole for small spaces.

Fan looks the same size as a fan from your Computer.-  Water reservoir is also small, but running it on high w/mist it'll last 6 hrs.-  The ""Swing"" function is nice but it's slow.  I tried it but stopped using it because of its sped.-  I did my own little temp check using a meat thermometer, holding it about 4-5in from fan, and here's the results:  -  My old fan, room @ 87 degrees, fan lowered temp to 81/82  -  This fan, room @ 87 degrees, fan with only water in it, lowered temp to 77/78  -  This fan, room @ 87 degrees, fan with water & ice in it, lowered temp to 71/72So it does work, but you need to be close to it to get the feeling it's working for you.  I have it maybe 18in from me so I feel the cooler air, but this thing in no way is going to cool a room.  I expected this so I give it a 4/5 knowing what my expectations were.

But, the directions say not to because it may damage the unit.I am still debating if I should return this thing, but I guess it's better than nothing.",blow design pretty nice feature cool please fooled like air conditioner rather small fan option adding misti figured could add ice cold water ice cube least chill mist direction say may damage uniti still debating return thing guess better nothing
530,B08FR7PNJK,,"August 17, 2020",Not Verified,Good value for money,"  It is the perfect size for my desk. As I work from home every other day, I needed a small fan. This fan is nice and works well when it's up close to you. It is great for personal use. I can turn the mist on or off depending on what I want and it does have 3-speed settings it is easy to use portable so both I and my sister can fight over it and use it lol. It is oscillating so it can freshen the air and I am very comfortable with air quality. I recommend this product to anyone looking for small fan.",Abdualrhman,5.0,"Good value for money  It is the perfect size for my desk. As I work from home every other day, I needed a small fan.

531,B08FR7PNJK,,"August 17, 2020",Not Verified,Better than I expected,"  Simple to use, just put the water into the reservoir/tank and re-insert back into the original placement. You can use this as a fan or a portable AC. It is cool enough and not using a lot of electricity, it comes with 3 different settings and the water mist is making my face comfortable and cool. It is energy efficient. but if you want to cover a large area, you might need a large ac, not a personal size ac. I love it and feel very comfortable without the large ac drying up my skin.",jacob severt,5.0,"Better than I expected  Simple to use, just put the water into the reservoir/tank and re-insert back into the original placement.
